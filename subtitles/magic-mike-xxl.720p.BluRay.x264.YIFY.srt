Just do it just like that.

98

We got a couple days
to perfect that.

99
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:57,421
Uh, look.

100
00:05:57,422 --> 00:05:59,323

two freak shows,

but it just can't be right now.

125

You know, low-overhead,
high-revenue shit.

320
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,168
That's how you get flush
in the food industry.

321
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:53,703
Fuck, yeah. What is this?
It's really good.

322
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,139
Oh, Goddamn right, what is this?
Jeez.

323
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,374
Fuck.
What am I eating right now?

324
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,309
- You like that, Mike?
- That's gold, right?

325
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,778
This is amazing.

326
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:03,880
It's toasted marshmallow
tangerine.

327
00:18:03,881 --> 00:18:05,949
Whatever it is,
it's fabulous.

328
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,351
Put marshmallow in my pants
right now.

329
00:18:08,352 --> 00:18:09,919
This is...
You gotta sell this.

330
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,355
Mike, tip of the iceberg, baby.

331
00:18:12,356 --> 00:18:14,623
We got Kiwi olive oil
with freeze-dried basil,

332
00:18:14,624 --> 00:18:17,626
crème brulée... and my personal
favorite, the flavor of truth.

333
00:18:17,627 --> 00:18:20,163
Come on, man. You've been
talking about this shit forever.

334
00:18:20,164 --> 00:18:21,597
Why don't you tell
everybody here

335
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,900
what you're really gonna
be doing come Monday morning.

336
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:28,972
Grinding those snow cones
at the Northdale Mall.

337
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:31,941
Yeah. Well, that's just
for market research, bitch.

338
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:34,343
Till we get the funds
to do what we really need.

339
00:18:34,344 --> 00:18:36,946
That's all it is, bro.
Fucking hater.

340
00:18:36,947 --> 00:18:40,249
Besides, I think it beats raking
the infield at Tropicana.

341
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,953
Well, at least the shit
I'm working on can go global.

342
00:18:43,954 --> 00:18:45,121
What?

343
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,956
- Wait. What?
- Yeah.

344
00:18:46,957 --> 00:18:48,391
I'm sorry.
What?

345
00:18:48,392 --> 00:18:51,761
Why don't you enlighten us,
constant gardener?

346
00:18:51,762 --> 00:18:53,296
Yeah, please...
Please enlighten me.

347
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:55,298
I have to know what this, like,
piece of genius is.

348
00:18:55,299 --> 00:18:58,034
Shamwow us
with your ingenious invention.

349
00:18:58,035 --> 00:19:00,870
Come on, rich, man.
Tito laid his shit out.

350
00:19:00,871 --> 00:19:02,205
Everybody's cool.
Just tell us.

351
00:19:02,206 --> 00:19:03,973
It's us, bro.

352
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,241
Just tell us, man.

353
00:19:05,242 --> 00:19:06,776
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

354
00:19:06,777 --> 00:19:08,311
All right.

355
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:10,346
But if any of you motherfuckers
steals my idea,

356
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,380
I swear to God I will...

357
00:19:11,381 --> 00:19:13,216
Why you got to point
at the fucking Mexican

358
00:19:13,217 --> 00:19:14,350
when you say "steals," dude?

359
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:16,185
We get it.
Just... just go.

360
00:19:16,186 --> 00:19:17,754
Let's have it, tough guy.

361
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:21,490
Condomints.

362
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,593
What are the two most important
things you need to take with you

363
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:26,729
when you go out on the weekend?

364
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,531
Ketchup and mustard?

365
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:32,335
Your condoms and your mints.

366
00:19:32,336 --> 00:19:34,437
Oh, my... what?

367
00:19:34,438 --> 00:19:37,073
I put them together in one
package, like a pack of gum.

368
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,408
Sell it at a gas station.

369
00:19:39,409 --> 00:19:40,743
"Condomints."

370
00:19:40,744 --> 00:19:42,645
It's not bad.
Boom!

371
00:19:42,646 --> 00:19:45,714
Um, they... they already
have that shit, bitch.

372
00:19:45,715 --> 00:19:48,818
You can get it.

373
00:19:48,819 --> 00:19:50,987
I get it all the time
at the minimart.

374
00:19:50,988 --> 00:19:52,521
I'm sorry.

375
00:19:52,522 --> 00:19:56,225
They're at every single circle k
and 7-Eleven across Florida.

376
00:19:56,226 --> 00:19:57,861
I'm so sorry, man.

377
00:19:57,862 --> 00:20:00,663
Hey, Richie, they didn't
sign the nondisclosure, man.

378
00:20:00,664 --> 00:20:02,031
Sorry about it.

379
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,432
Hey, Richie,
don't worry about it.

380
00:20:03,433 --> 00:20:05,068
I got something for you...
Top secret, man.

381
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:08,104
Imagine this.
A small, little rectangle. Okay?

382
00:20:08,105 --> 00:20:10,639
You hold it up to your ear,
you speak into it,

383
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,609
somebody in a distant land
with the exact same thing

384
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,978
can hear it.

385
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:16,679
I just haven't come up with
a name for it.

386
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,414
I was figuring...

387
00:20:18,415 --> 00:20:20,884
Fuck... you.
I'm so sorry, man.

388
00:20:20,885 --> 00:20:22,618
Oh, God.

389
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:26,122
Hey, I forgot to ask you...
You still with Mercedes?

390
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:27,723
No.

391
00:20:27,724 --> 00:20:31,060
We agreed to try monogamy,
and you know Mercedes.

392
00:20:31,061 --> 00:20:33,496
That shit lasted
for about two seconds.

393
00:20:33,497 --> 00:20:36,099
Wow. That fucking sucks.
I'm sorry.

394
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,835
Ah, it's like Oprah said,
man...

395
00:20:39,836 --> 00:20:43,307
"when someone shows you
themselves, believe them."

396
00:20:45,309 --> 00:20:46,943
What? Really?

397
00:20:46,944 --> 00:20:49,012
Really? I... okay. Yeah, really.
That's what she said.

398
00:20:49,013 --> 00:20:50,746
Are we doing
this passive-aggressive shit?

399
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:52,348
Okay. Fine. That's not
passive-aggressive, that's Oprah.

400
00:20:52,349 --> 00:20:53,782
Let's fucking make it
aggressive.

401
00:20:53,783 --> 00:20:56,385
How about this? Let's do
a little therapy session here.

402
00:20:56,386 --> 00:20:58,054
Old-school...
Old-school therapy session.

403
00:20:58,055 --> 00:20:59,488
Get up. Let's go. We're gonna
get this out in one swing.

404
00:20:59,489 --> 00:21:01,190
Are we fucking primates now, man?
Come on.

405
00:21:01,191 --> 00:21:03,259
Get it out in one hit and let's
not talk about it anymore.

406
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:05,962
I get it. You're mad that... that I fucking
left. This is seriously fucking stupid.

407
00:21:05,963 --> 00:21:07,430
Come on, baby.
Let's go. Right here.

408
00:21:07,431 --> 00:21:09,365
Just don't hit me in the fucking nuts.
Bam. Wow.

409
00:21:09,366 --> 00:21:11,134
Are you kidding me? Stop being a pussy.
Everybody fucking happy?

410
00:21:11,135 --> 00:21:12,501
Stop being a pussy. Let's go.
No, man.

411
00:21:12,502 --> 00:21:14,203
Don't you call me a fucking
pussy, Christian Bale.

412
00:21:14,204 --> 00:21:15,671
No. He didn't call you a pussy.

413
00:21:15,672 --> 00:21:17,907
He... he just said you exhibited
pussy-like behavior.

414
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,642
Y'all want to unleash the fucking tiger?
It's just the behavior of a pussy.

415
00:21:19,643 --> 00:21:21,110
Is that what you want? Come on!
Release the demon!

416
00:21:21,111 --> 00:21:22,511
Oh! Shit!

417
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:23,980
Tiger's out.

418
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:32,088
Are you okay, man?

419
00:21:32,089 --> 00:21:34,090
You feel better?

420
00:21:34,091 --> 00:21:35,758
No, man,
I don't fucking feel better.

421
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:37,493
That was seriously fucked up.

422
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,195
Okay.

423
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:40,463
Good.
You all right?

424
00:21:40,464 --> 00:21:42,431
Yeah.
I just got to pee a little.

425
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:44,867
Everybody happy? You get
your fucking gladiator show?

426
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:46,169
That was fucking awesome.

427
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,636
No, it wasn't fucking awesome,
man.

428
00:21:47,637 --> 00:21:49,438
There are a lot better ways
to handle that shit.

429
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:51,440
It's our last fucking ride.
I'm outta here.

430
00:21:51,441 --> 00:21:53,876
You know, it's always
the pretty ones, like Bundy.

431
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,380
It is, man.

432
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:03,119
There you go. That's it.
That... that's perfect.

433
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,838
Yo. That's
protected land, sir!

434
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:26,409
You're destroying sea Turtle
biosphere with that urine.

435
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,277
Are you serious right now?
Come on.

436
00:22:28,278 --> 00:22:30,646
Really? All right.
Well, don't look at me.

437
00:22:30,647 --> 00:22:32,915
Look out into the ocean.
Got it. I got it.

438
00:22:32,916 --> 00:22:34,250
Get the picture here?
I'm running out.

439
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,319
Yes. Thank you.
I'm done.

440
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,654
That's... that's it.
There we go.

441
00:22:38,655 --> 00:22:43,426
That's... that's usually what
happens when I pee on the beach.

442
00:22:43,427 --> 00:22:45,928
Yeah. Yeah.

443
00:22:45,929 --> 00:22:48,464
Drag queens. That's, uh...

444
00:22:48,465 --> 00:22:50,599
Ooh, doing Drag Queen stuff.

445
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,968
You love Drag Queens.

446
00:22:52,969 --> 00:22:54,337
Yep.

447
00:22:54,338 --> 00:22:57,740
I am one,
so I seek out my people.

448
00:22:57,741 --> 00:23:00,876
You are one? You are one?
Mm-hmm. On the inside.

449
00:23:00,877 --> 00:23:01,977
Got it.
Mostly.

450
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,212
Of course it's on the inside.

451
00:23:03,213 --> 00:23:04,447
Yeah.
What's her name?

452
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,848
Dolly Titz.

453
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:06,882
Dolly Tits?

454
00:23:06,883 --> 00:23:07,883
With a "z."

455
00:23:07,884 --> 00:23:08,951
With a "z."
Mm-hmm.

456
00:23:08,952 --> 00:23:10,019
Where is she from?

457
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,220
Here.
Okay.

458
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:13,856
And she loves couponing
and Nascar.

459
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:15,724
I got an inner Drag Queen, too.

460
00:23:15,725 --> 00:23:16,925
Oh. Really?
Yeah.

461
00:23:16,926 --> 00:23:18,827
Okay. I figured.

462
00:23:18,828 --> 00:23:20,496
Uh, what's her name?

463
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:22,331
Her name is...

464
00:23:22,332 --> 00:23:24,933
Clitoria Labia is her name.

465
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,435
That's actually not bad.

466
00:23:26,436 --> 00:23:28,637
It's not bad at all.
She's... she's the main bitch.

467
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:31,174
She's like Cheetara
and Grace Jones.

468
00:23:31,175 --> 00:23:34,343
And they always sing
"Rapper's Delight"

469
00:23:34,344 --> 00:23:35,878
everywhere they go.

470
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:44,220
So, you and your friends, um,
frequent drag shows, do you?

471
00:23:44,221 --> 00:23:46,489
No.
Not... well, somet...

472
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,158
We just do it on the way up
to myrtle beach every year.

473
00:23:49,159 --> 00:23:51,260
Right.
Oh, right.

474
00:23:51,261 --> 00:23:54,163
This stripper convention
that I keep hearing about.

475
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:57,100
Yep.
It's the infamous convention.

476
00:23:57,101 --> 00:23:59,602
Which one are you, then?
You, um...

477
00:23:59,603 --> 00:24:00,703
Which what?

478
00:24:00,704 --> 00:24:05,074
Are you Cop in a thong
or Iron Man in a thong?

479
00:24:05,075 --> 00:24:07,343
I am... I am...

480
00:24:07,344 --> 00:24:09,278
You're gonna have to pay
to see that.

481
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,680
That's what I am.

482
00:24:11,681 --> 00:24:15,351
Or I'll just load up on all
those fantastic '80s hair bands

483
00:24:15,352 --> 00:24:17,153
for my drive instead.

484
00:24:17,154 --> 00:24:18,287
Where you going?
Where you headed?

485
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:21,657
Uh...
Just on the road again.

486
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:23,826
New York this time.
Okay.

487
00:24:23,827 --> 00:24:25,594
Um, and I...

488
00:24:25,595 --> 00:24:28,764
Basically, I'm just trying to
avoid ending up on the pole.

489
00:24:28,765 --> 00:24:30,133
Like you.

490
00:24:30,134 --> 00:24:31,867
But you never know.

491
00:24:31,868 --> 00:24:34,703
"Stripper pissing on beach
in contemplative pose"

492
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:36,539
could sell for thousands
one day.

493
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,941
If that's true,
then I will whip it out

494
00:24:38,942 --> 00:24:42,211
and start peeing on whatever
you tell me to pee on,

495
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:44,213
and we can just...
We can cash in.

496
00:24:44,214 --> 00:24:47,049
Fantastic.
I love the Enthusiasm.

497
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,551
Save some of it, though,

498
00:24:48,552 --> 00:24:51,654
because you and I are gonna
untie that sailboat over there

499
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,323
and organize a first-ever
cross-dressing search party

500
00:24:54,324 --> 00:24:55,391
out to that island.

501
00:24:55,392 --> 00:24:56,525
What do you say?

502
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:59,328
Uh...
Win or Die, stripper guy.

503
00:24:59,329 --> 00:25:01,364
I-I say that, um...

504
00:25:01,365 --> 00:25:03,766
I would actually love
to do that.

505
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:06,235
But I'd say I know what happens
on that island,

506
00:25:06,236 --> 00:25:09,238
and I just... that's just...
Mm-hmm.

507
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,606
I think I'm gonna opt out.

508
00:25:10,607 --> 00:25:13,909
Oh.
What happens on that island?

509
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,713
It's just I know what happens
for me on that island.

510
00:25:17,714 --> 00:25:20,115
Oh, I see.

511
00:25:20,116 --> 00:25:22,451
You think I'm gonna hook up
with you. Mm.

512
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,820
That's not at all what I said.
At all.

513
00:25:24,821 --> 00:25:26,789
That's the farthest thing
from what I said.

514
00:25:26,790 --> 00:25:28,824
'Cause I said I would want to go
to that island,

515
00:25:28,825 --> 00:25:30,759
and then I know
what I would do

516
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,861
and then somehow that probably
wouldn't work out

517
00:25:32,862 --> 00:25:35,198
on any level that I would
want it to work out on,

518
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,599
and then I think

519
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,001
that it's probably better
if I just go back.

520
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,469
Yeah.

521
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,637
Wow.

522
00:25:41,638 --> 00:25:42,738
Okay.

523
00:25:42,739 --> 00:25:46,642
Well, fret not, Casanova.
You're safe with me.

524
00:25:46,643 --> 00:25:49,178
I'm not going through
a guy phase anyway.

525
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:50,613
Oh.

526
00:25:50,614 --> 00:25:53,015
Well, in that case,
that makes things easier.

527
00:25:53,016 --> 00:25:55,751
Yeah. 'Cause then
all the more reason

528
00:25:55,752 --> 00:25:59,388
for me to probably just go do
the good-night thing.

529
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:00,823
Okay. Yeah.

530
00:26:00,824 --> 00:26:03,492
It was nice to meet you, though,
Dolly Titz.

531
00:26:03,493 --> 00:26:06,663
Back at you, Clitoria.

532
00:26:27,517 --> 00:26:30,018
Good morning.
Good morning.

533
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,655
You sleep okay?

534
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:35,791
Yeah.
Actually, I did.

535
00:26:35,792 --> 00:26:37,993
Mm-hmm.

536
00:26:40,497 --> 00:26:42,965
My meditation was really clear
this morning, man.

537
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:47,304
I just... just feel like I got
a lot of the negativity out.

538
00:26:48,905 --> 00:26:50,038
That's... that's good.

539
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,173
Yeah.
That's good.

540
00:26:51,174 --> 00:26:52,809
I'm happy you feel lighter.

541
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:57,380
I'm happy you finally got
what you wanted, man.

542
00:26:57,381 --> 00:26:58,614
Yeah?
I am.

543
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:01,049
No. I... we say shit
all the fucking time,

544
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:02,485
but you went and did it, man.

545
00:27:02,486 --> 00:27:04,553
I'm jealous.
Oh... oh, shut the fuck up.

546
00:27:04,554 --> 00:27:06,522
All right?
I'm fucking jealous. I am.

547
00:27:06,523 --> 00:27:08,524
No. If there's anybody
that was jealous, it was me.

548
00:27:08,525 --> 00:27:11,026
What? Every time I would come
over to your apartment...

549
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:13,228
Remember?
I'd put on your tide commercial.

550
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:16,064
That shit was dope.

551
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:19,502
♪ For that extra clean! ♪
♪ For that extra clean! ♪

552
00:27:19,503 --> 00:27:22,137
Ding!
Oh, shit.

553
00:27:22,138 --> 00:27:23,506
I mean, Lookit.

554
00:27:23,507 --> 00:27:25,107
I would...
I would think to myself,

555
00:27:25,108 --> 00:27:27,610
"I'd be set if I could just get
to where Ken was."

556
00:27:27,611 --> 00:27:29,077
Yeah, I'm real set here.

557
00:27:29,078 --> 00:27:30,413
I'm real set.

558
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:32,848
My agent's got me doing
Youtube videos now, man.

559
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:35,851
So what are you gonna do
after this weekend?

560
00:27:35,852 --> 00:27:38,721
Send my head shot around,
hope for the best.

561
00:27:38,722 --> 00:27:42,692
There's a casting director comes
by the club sometimes, so...

562
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,194
I'm still pretty.

563
00:27:46,195 --> 00:27:48,797
Yeah.

564
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:53,369
I know you're still pretty,
but look at these guys.

565
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,871
What are they gonna do
after this?

566
00:27:55,872 --> 00:27:57,406
I don't know.

567
00:27:57,407 --> 00:27:59,608
Morning, gorgeous.

568
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:02,110
Oh, my God,
did you guys even sleep?

569
00:28:04,514 --> 00:28:06,482
Are the girls still here
or they leave?

570
00:28:06,483 --> 00:28:09,718
Oh, they left about a...
About an hour ago.

571
00:28:11,321 --> 00:28:13,722
Did you, uh,
did you bangee?

572
00:28:13,723 --> 00:28:15,859
You bangee?
Show him the thing.

573
00:28:18,227 --> 00:28:20,128
Wow.

574
00:28:20,129 --> 00:28:21,597
That's... okay.

575
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:24,700
She said if I had reason to call
before it faded,

576
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,435
then maybe it was meant to be.

577
00:28:26,436 --> 00:28:28,937
Oh.
That's... that's romantic.

578
00:28:28,938 --> 00:28:32,074
They're staying in Charleston
tonight, so...

579
00:28:32,075 --> 00:28:33,842
I don't know.
It's smack dab on our way.

580
00:28:33,843 --> 00:28:35,511
Maybe it was meant to be.
Yeah, man.

581
00:28:35,512 --> 00:28:37,513
Good work on that,
by the way.

582
00:28:37,514 --> 00:28:38,847
What about you?

583
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:39,783
Did you bangee?

584
00:28:39,784 --> 00:28:42,518
No.
No?

585
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:45,788
I haven't had actual sex
in almost five months.

586
00:28:45,789 --> 00:28:49,124
Every time a chick gets...
A look at it,

587
00:28:49,125 --> 00:28:52,094
she's like, "how about
a blow job or hand job?"

588
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:53,862
Well...

589
00:28:53,863 --> 00:28:56,264
Just got to find
the right lady, man.

590
00:28:56,265 --> 00:28:57,866
That's unfortunate for you.

591
00:28:57,867 --> 00:29:00,469
It's like a blessing and a curse
at the same time, huh?

592
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,937
Laugh at my plight.

593
00:29:01,938 --> 00:29:04,407
Look, m-maybe it's like
the glass slipper, man.

594
00:29:04,408 --> 00:29:06,909
You just need to find
the right one.

595
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:08,811
Dude, I'm 35 years old, okay?

596
00:29:08,812 --> 00:29:11,447
If it hasn't happened already,
it ain't gonna happen.

597
00:29:11,448 --> 00:29:13,281
Let's face it,
I'm probably fucked.

598
00:29:13,282 --> 00:29:14,917
Oh.
All right.

599
00:29:14,918 --> 00:29:17,386
On that note, uh, let's get
this circus back on the road.

600
00:29:17,387 --> 00:29:19,855
Who wants to see if Tarzan died
in his sleep last night?

601
00:29:19,856 --> 00:29:22,658
Fuck that, man.
I woke him up last time.

602
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:24,593
I'll do it.
I got it.

603
00:29:24,594 --> 00:29:27,631
I'll clean up
the nonbiodegradables.

604
00:29:36,305 --> 00:29:37,473
What's up, bro?

605
00:29:37,474 --> 00:29:39,408
A little, uh,
breakfast of champions?

606
00:29:39,409 --> 00:29:41,043
Molly?
Yeah.

607
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:42,845
You realize we'll be useless
in an hour.

608
00:29:42,846 --> 00:29:44,780
What are you, fucking 12, dude?
Just take it.

609
00:29:44,781 --> 00:29:46,582
Oh, fuck!
All right. Fine.

610
00:29:46,583 --> 00:29:48,551
Guess I know
what today's gonna be like.

611
00:29:48,552 --> 00:29:51,887
All right,
get your moon rocks!

612
00:29:51,888 --> 00:29:54,557
All right. So what's the plan
about this thing?

613
00:29:54,558 --> 00:29:56,124
Okay.
So we got it all planned out.

614
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,860
Tobias is gonna warm up
the crowd,

615
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:59,194
then we're gonna hit them

616
00:29:59,195 --> 00:30:01,096
with the old 4th of July
army routine. Oorah.

617
00:30:01,097 --> 00:30:02,965
That still makes me
feel like a warmonger

618
00:30:02,966 --> 00:30:04,900
with everything going on
politically right now.

619
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,802
Oh, come on
with the hippie shit.

620
00:30:06,803 --> 00:30:08,403
It's in season.
We're doing it.

621
00:30:08,404 --> 00:30:10,973
Hey, if you want that Karma,
go for it, all right?

622
00:30:10,974 --> 00:30:13,842
We're gonna hit them with
"Raining Men" right after.

623
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:14,843
Right.

624
00:30:14,844 --> 00:30:16,812
Then Tobias is gonna intro
the solos.

625
00:30:16,813 --> 00:30:17,980
Listen.

626
00:30:17,981 --> 00:30:20,983
I think you should bring back
"Pony," bro.

627
00:30:20,984 --> 00:30:23,085
I could do that.

628
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,153
And I'm...
Look, "Pony" is great.

629
00:30:25,154 --> 00:30:27,756
I have, uh...
Can I pitch you something?

630
00:30:27,757 --> 00:30:29,391
Let me just
throw something out.

631
00:30:29,392 --> 00:30:32,695
And I completely understand that
I'm coming in at the 11th hour,

632
00:30:32,696 --> 00:30:34,563
and I don't want to step
on toes.

633
00:30:34,564 --> 00:30:36,699
But what if...

634
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:38,501
I mean, if this really is
our last ride,

635
00:30:38,502 --> 00:30:41,269
what if we make up some new shit
and go out with a fucking bang

636
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:43,706
and just burn this shit down
with some new routines?

637
00:30:43,707 --> 00:30:46,208
We... we can't do that, man.
We got two days.

638
00:30:46,209 --> 00:30:49,645
I mean, Mike, that's what
we've rehearsed, man.

639
00:30:49,646 --> 00:30:52,615
Yeah, and don't call our shit lame, bro.
You're right. You know what?

640
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:54,149
I'm not calling your shit lame.

641
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,018
I'm just saying that cowboys
and firemen dancing to '80s rock

642
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:58,020
is not... not lame.
No. You know what is lame?

643
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:00,022
Looking like a bag of dicks
at our last convention

644
00:31:00,023 --> 00:31:02,090
'cause we don't have
our fucking act straight.

645
00:31:02,091 --> 00:31:03,091
Okay.
Point taken.

646
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:05,293
Let me ask you a question,
though.

647
00:31:05,294 --> 00:31:07,029
Um... okay.

648
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:09,665
You're still doing, uh,
the fireman routine, right?

649
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:10,966
You know it.
All right.

650
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,935
Have you ever wanted to be
a fireman?

651
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:15,538
A real one?
Yes, a real fireman.

652
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:17,472
No.
I got the phobia thing.

653
00:31:17,473 --> 00:31:18,874
You have a fire phobia.
Okay.

654
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,076
So, uh, you still doing it
to that... that kiss song?

655
00:31:21,077 --> 00:31:22,578
Fuck, yeah.
"Hotter than Hell."

656
00:31:22,579 --> 00:31:23,979
"Hotter than Hell."
Do you like that song?

657
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,080
Crushes.

658
00:31:25,081 --> 00:31:27,082
I know it crushes,
but do you like it?

659
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,351
Do you play it
when you're not onstage?

660
00:31:29,352 --> 00:31:30,819
I don't see your point here.

661
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,955
My point is, if you don't
like it, why did you pick it?

662
00:31:32,956 --> 00:31:34,623
Well, I didn't pick it.
Dallas did.

663
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,224
Exactly my point.
Dallas picked it.

664
00:31:36,225 --> 00:31:38,326
You didn't pick it, so it's not
on the inside. You know what?

665
00:31:38,327 --> 00:31:40,362
Just because you made up some of
your own routines back in the day

666
00:31:40,363 --> 00:31:42,164
doesn't mean that you get to
waltz back in here

667
00:31:42,165 --> 00:31:44,066
after three years and try to
tell us how to run our own shit.

668
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,968
I'm not trying to tell you
what the fuck to do. No!

669
00:31:45,969 --> 00:31:47,402
I'm just say...
There is no fucking universe

670
00:31:47,403 --> 00:31:50,740
in which I am not doing
that fireman routine!

671
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,910
You can find it, man.

672
00:31:54,911 --> 00:31:56,745
You got to just, like,
let go, okay?

673
00:31:56,746 --> 00:31:58,647
I fucking got it!
What? What?

674
00:31:58,648 --> 00:32:00,716
Yo, it's like
a fucking real wedding,

675
00:32:00,717 --> 00:32:02,651
- except like a fantasy.
- Oh, my God, dude!

676
00:32:02,652 --> 00:32:04,119
And, like, I go out in the crowd...
Yes!

677
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,121
...and find myself, like,
a real fucking bride.

678
00:32:06,122 --> 00:32:09,024
Oh, fuck! And I do
everything with her!

679
00:32:09,025 --> 00:32:11,159
Like, I'll have a ring
and everything,

680
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:14,096
and I'll propose to her, and people
throw rice. They are throwing rice!

681
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:16,264
Rice out of our fucking pants! Yes.
Dude, they're fucking...

682
00:32:16,265 --> 00:32:18,066
They're all... everyone's throwing rice.
It's just so complex.

683
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,501
Or birdseed. What are you
fucking talking about, man?!

684
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:21,069
Yo, man, I'm not
a fucking dancer like you.

685
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,838
I just can't come up with shit
on the spot.

686
00:32:22,839 --> 00:32:25,841
No, it's not... it's not about
being a dancer, Richie.

687
00:32:25,842 --> 00:32:27,309
It's not.
Okay, look.

688
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,278
"Pony"... it's not... that
wasn't a dance routine, okay?

689
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:33,448
All it was is I was at a party
and saw this badass girl.

690
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:34,917
And she was with her boyfriend,

691
00:32:34,918 --> 00:32:37,219
and he did not look like
he was hitting that shit right.

692
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,454
So that... that song came on,
and all I did was just...

693
00:32:39,455 --> 00:32:41,990
All I did was just, like,
imagine what I would do to her.

694
00:32:41,991 --> 00:32:43,959
That was it.
That was all "Pony" ever was.

695
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,694
No, man.
It sounds fucking complex.

696
00:32:45,695 --> 00:32:47,963
Why is that... no, it's not.
Look at... look at you!

697
00:32:47,964 --> 00:32:49,564
You're a fucking Greek God.

698
00:32:49,565 --> 00:32:51,099
You could fucking tie your shoe

699
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,035
and make some girl's
entire year, man.

700
00:32:53,036 --> 00:32:54,536
It's just got to come from
in here.

701
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,538
Seriously? You just have to be you.
Yeah. I know so.

702
00:32:56,539 --> 00:32:57,773
You know what?
Fuck that.

703
00:32:57,774 --> 00:32:59,307
I bet you you can go in there
right now...

704
00:32:59,308 --> 00:33:01,576
I bet you you can go in there
and fucking make her day.

705
00:33:01,577 --> 00:33:03,445
Who, her? Tarzan: Hell, yeah.
Hell, yeah.

706
00:33:03,446 --> 00:33:05,447
That girl looks like
she's never fucking smiled

707
00:33:05,448 --> 00:33:07,816
in her entire fucking life.
Then that's your goal.

708
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:09,317
That is your goal. All the
more reason, man. What?

709
00:33:09,318 --> 00:33:10,686
You got to go in there
and make her smile. No!

710
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:11,820
That's it.
That's all you've got to do.

711
00:33:11,821 --> 00:33:13,121
Yes.
And if you... look.

712
00:33:13,122 --> 00:33:14,990
If you can't do that,
then no one fucking can,

713
00:33:14,991 --> 00:33:16,892
and I'll go back and do
the fucking old routines.

714
00:33:16,893 --> 00:33:19,327
Oh, fuck! That's a fair deal.
That's a fair deal.

715
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:21,730
You're not a fucking...
You're not a fireman, Richie!

716
00:33:21,731 --> 00:33:23,799
You're not a fireman.
I want to hear you say it.

717
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,467
"I'm not a fireman."
"I am not a fireman."

718
00:33:25,468 --> 00:33:27,069
I want to hear you say...
Well, I'm not a fucking fireman.

719
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,904
You hate fire!
I'm a fucking male entertainer.

720
00:33:28,905 --> 00:33:30,072
Exactly!
You're a male entertainer.

721
00:33:30,073 --> 00:33:31,406
Right, man.
You can fucking do it.

722
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:32,607
Now go do it!
B.D.R.!

723
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:33,642
B.D.R.!

724
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:35,210
Come on!
B.D.R.! B.D.R.!

725
00:33:40,249 --> 00:33:41,316
Make her day, dude.

726
00:33:41,317 --> 00:33:43,385

That was spiritual, man.

762
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,380
Yes!
I'm proud of you, buddy.

763
00:35:52,381 --> 00:35:53,748
We can do this.

764
00:35:53,749 --> 00:35:55,050
We can do this!
We can do this.

765
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:57,786
We've got to come up with
new shit, okay?

766
00:35:57,787 --> 00:36:00,088
Fucking history right here,
okay?

767
00:36:00,089 --> 00:36:01,990
This shit is history.
Gone.

768
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,692
We've got to get rid of it.
Out with the past.

769
00:36:04,693 --> 00:36:06,294
I never wanted to be
in the Navy!

770
00:36:06,295 --> 00:36:08,330
I don't want this "Top Gun" shit.
Fuck the Navy, man.

771
00:36:08,331 --> 00:36:09,597
Yeah!
Gone!

772
00:36:09,598 --> 00:36:12,167
Oh, baby!
It's time.

773
00:36:12,168 --> 00:36:13,568
That shit itched.
It's time.

774
00:36:13,569 --> 00:36:14,669
Boom.

775
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:15,938
Boom!
That's outta here, baby!

776
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,840
Fuck that thing!
Richie?

777
00:36:17,841 --> 00:36:19,875
Done! Fireman over!
Not anymore.

778
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:21,977
I'm not a fireman anymore!

779
00:36:21,978 --> 00:36:23,311
Get it outta here.
Don't, man. Don't.

780
00:36:23,312 --> 00:36:24,947
I'll... I'll throw it away
when we get back.

781
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:26,181
No, no, no.
Now!

782
00:36:26,182 --> 00:36:28,383
It's over.
History!

783
00:36:28,384 --> 00:36:29,285
New stuff.

784
00:36:29,286 --> 00:36:32,154
I love you guys.
I... look.

785
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:33,455
I've missed you guys so much.

786
00:36:33,456 --> 00:36:35,190
I know we're rolling face
right now,

787
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:37,826
but, like, I just need you guys
to know how much I love you.

788
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,727
I missed you so much, man.

789
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:41,063
There was a giant hole
inside of me

790
00:36:41,064 --> 00:36:42,630
that was created when you left.

791
00:36:42,631 --> 00:36:44,332
I'm here now. And now I
feel like it's full again.

792
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,168
- I love you, man.
- Let's sync this shit up.

793
00:36:46,169 --> 00:36:47,635
We gotta sync this up.

794
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:50,172
We're syncing up the energy.
I fucking love you, man!

795
00:36:50,173 --> 00:36:52,274
Give me your hands, man.

796
00:36:52,275 --> 00:36:53,408
Whoo!

797
00:36:53,409 --> 00:36:55,677
I take it y'all motherfuckers
feel that?

798
00:36:55,678 --> 00:36:56,711
Oh, yeah.
Yeah!

799
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:58,746
That is our energies, man.

800
00:36:58,747 --> 00:37:00,682
We are connected.
Hold...

801
00:37:00,683 --> 00:37:03,418
Toby! Toby, throw it back here,
brother. We need you.

802
00:37:03,419 --> 00:37:04,853
Come on.
Come on, man, sync up.

803
00:37:04,854 --> 00:37:06,821
Come on!
This is powerful, man!

804
00:37:06,822 --> 00:37:08,523
You feel that rhythm?
Oh, yeah.

805
00:37:08,524 --> 00:37:10,192
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪

806
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,359
Yeah.
Ooh, yeah.

807
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,461
♪ Mm, mm-mm-mm ♪
I love you guys!

808
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:14,629
That's our pulse, man.

809
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:16,932
I am so thankful
that we are all here together

810
00:37:16,933 --> 00:37:18,166
on this last ride, man.

811
00:37:18,167 --> 00:37:20,435
Everybody...
Everybody close your eyes

812
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:23,939
and let's just appreciate it,
not as six beings, but as one.

813
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:26,074
As one.
As one. As one unit, man.

814
00:37:26,075 --> 00:37:27,609
One fucking unit.

815
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,544
As one. We've got to move
into the future as one.

816
00:37:29,545 --> 00:37:32,147
As one unit.
One unit moving as one.

817
00:37:32,148 --> 00:37:33,681
The past is over!

818
00:37:33,682 --> 00:37:34,983
Yeah.

819
00:37:34,984 --> 00:37:38,054
Shit!

820
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,027
Ugh.

821
00:37:45,028 --> 00:37:46,461
Fuck!
What the hell happened?

822
00:37:46,462 --> 00:37:48,130
Ow! Get off!
Get off my fucking leg!

823
00:37:48,131 --> 00:37:49,131
Ugh. Fuck!

824
00:37:49,132 --> 00:37:50,432
Is everybody okay?

825
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,935
No, I'm not fucking okay!
I'm not okay at all!

826
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:56,571
Oh, shit.
Hey, we got a man down!

827
00:37:56,572 --> 00:37:58,273
Oh, fuck.
Where'd that come from?

828
00:37:58,274 --> 00:38:00,042
He hit his fucking head there.
Oh, shit.

829
00:38:00,043 --> 00:38:01,409
He's okay.

830
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:03,611
Your friend suffered
a Grade-2 concussion

831
00:38:03,612 --> 00:38:04,812
and required some stitches.

832
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:07,415
So he's gonna live?
Yes.

833
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:10,986
He'll need to stay here
for 48 hours of observation.

834
00:38:10,987 --> 00:38:11,987
He's in here.

835
00:38:11,988 --> 00:38:13,488
My pupils bugging out?

836
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:15,123
Shh. Be cool.

837
00:38:15,124 --> 00:38:18,193
You think she knows?

838
00:38:20,629 --> 00:38:23,098
Oh, shit, man.

839
00:38:23,099 --> 00:38:25,167
Hey. Toby.

840
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:27,102
What's up, buddy? Hey, bro.
What's up, man?

841
00:38:27,103 --> 00:38:28,536
Oh, fuck.
Hey, guys.

842
00:38:28,537 --> 00:38:29,637
I'm so fucking sorry.

843
00:38:29,638 --> 00:38:31,473
No. No. I shouldn't have reached
for you, man.

844
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,241
Fuck, man.
I shouldn't have closed my eyes.

845
00:38:33,242 --> 00:38:34,509
Well, that's definitely true.

846
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,945
Fuck, yeah.
I mean, what were you thinking?

847
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:38,280
Hey. Hey, hey.
Go easy on him, man.

848
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,715
Come on. Look at him.
Easy? He's fine.

849
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:44,152
Right? Yeah, I'm fine, but
the fucking truck, man.

850
00:38:44,153 --> 00:38:45,553
Yeah, the truck is towed.

851
00:38:45,554 --> 00:38:48,090
It's going to take a few days
to fix it.

852
00:38:48,091 --> 00:38:49,992
But I think we can afford it.

853
00:38:49,993 --> 00:38:52,427
I just... I don't know
about the paint job.

854
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:54,997
It won't be original,
but, uh, I can get it close.

855
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,364
Are you in pain, man?

856
00:38:56,365 --> 00:38:58,400
Yeah. They gave me a little bit
of something,

857
00:38:58,401 --> 00:39:01,069
but it's just, like, shit.
Yeah, I'm feeling that.

858
00:39:02,972 --> 00:39:04,539
What are you doing?

859
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,108
Reiki.

860
00:39:06,109 --> 00:39:08,110
I'm a level-3 healer.

861
00:39:08,111 --> 00:39:09,411
Oh, shit.

862
00:39:09,412 --> 00:39:12,147
This fucking sucks.

863
00:39:12,148 --> 00:39:14,949
No fucking M.C.
No fucking whip.

864
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,318
No fucking costumes!

865
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,752
That was a brilliant idea.

866
00:39:17,753 --> 00:39:19,654
Throwing the fucking costumes
out the window?

867
00:39:19,655 --> 00:39:22,690
Stupid! Just chill, man. No, man.
It's an Omen, okay?

868
00:39:22,691 --> 00:39:24,226
It's a sign.

869
00:39:24,227 --> 00:39:27,529
We're exactly where we're
supposed to be, all right?

870
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,299
Please spare us the fucking
Gandhi routine right now!

871
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,468
Okay.
You have so much anger, man.

872
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:35,737
And it is all in your heart
chakra, and it's fucking toxic.

873
00:39:35,738 --> 00:39:38,440
Look, guys, please just chill. I
don't even know what that means!

874
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:40,908
Come on! This is the comedown
from the Molly.

875
00:39:40,909 --> 00:39:44,746
Get a grip. God. You're Goddamn
right it's fucking comedown!

876
00:39:44,747 --> 00:39:46,048
This trip's over!

877
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:48,883
All I wanted
was one more fucking ride!

878
00:39:48,884 --> 00:39:50,752
Is that too much to ask?

879
00:39:50,753 --> 00:39:52,220
Aw.

880
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:53,688
Is Richie gonna cry

881
00:39:53,689 --> 00:39:55,857
because life isn't exactly
the way he wants it right now?

882
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:58,326
Oh, okay, Mr. C.E.O.

883
00:39:58,327 --> 00:40:00,228
Why don't you take
your bullshit advice

884
00:40:00,229 --> 00:40:03,265
and give it
to your fucking employees?

885
00:40:03,266 --> 00:40:05,100
Employees?
I have one employee.

886
00:40:05,101 --> 00:40:07,269
And I can't even pay
for his healthcare.

887
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,804
But I bust my ass every month
to keep it going.

888
00:40:09,805 --> 00:40:11,873
So don't act like
we don't all have problems.

889
00:40:11,874 --> 00:40:13,541
All right?
Oh, whatever, man.

890
00:40:13,542 --> 00:40:16,444
I'm the one who told you coming
with us was a horrible idea.

891
00:40:16,445 --> 00:40:21,383
Oh, it's been the year
of the horrible idea, man.

892
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:23,718
You want to see
another horrible idea?

893
00:40:23,719 --> 00:40:25,654
I got one for you.

894
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:28,723
Bam.
There you go.

895
00:40:28,724 --> 00:40:32,760
There's a nice, juicy
horrible idea for you.

896
00:40:32,761 --> 00:40:34,129
Brooke said no?

897
00:40:34,130 --> 00:40:36,931
Look, I had my life
all planned out with her.

898
00:40:36,932 --> 00:40:39,434
All right? I...
It was all perfectly set up.

899
00:40:39,435 --> 00:40:40,668
I had the house,
I had the dog,

900
00:40:40,669 --> 00:40:42,137
I had "Downton Abbey"
on the weekends.

901
00:40:42,138 --> 00:40:43,838
I even did the proposal
on the beach

902
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:46,841
with bacon and mimosas
and pancakes and all that.

903
00:40:46,842 --> 00:40:48,076
And for whatever reason

904
00:40:48,077 --> 00:40:50,145
that I'll probably never
understand...

905
00:40:50,146 --> 00:40:51,513
She wanted something else.

906
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:53,648
So I came on this trip
with you fucks

907
00:40:53,649 --> 00:40:55,883
to just try to get on with it.

908
00:40:55,884 --> 00:40:58,286
So I'm gonna be damned
if I'm gonna just let it end

909
00:40:58,287 --> 00:41:00,055
right here and now.

910
00:41:00,889 --> 00:41:02,390
You're right.

911
00:41:02,391 --> 00:41:05,493
You're Goddamn right.

912
00:41:05,494 --> 00:41:08,430
We can't let the train
stop here.

913
00:41:08,431 --> 00:41:09,797
That's right.
No.

914
00:41:09,798 --> 00:41:12,334
We got a Tsunami of dollar bills
to get to, daddy.

915
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:13,801
Oh, we're on a mission.
Fuck, yeah.

916
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:16,538
Look, we'll get another M.C.
Right, Tobias?

917
00:41:16,539 --> 00:41:19,674
That's the energy
I'm talking about right there.

918
00:41:19,675 --> 00:41:22,444
Look, we'll pick him up
on the way home.

919
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:24,446
All we got to do
is get a rental car.

920
00:41:24,447 --> 00:41:28,183
We're not gonna need
a rental car, I don't think.

921
00:41:28,184 --> 00:41:31,119
This is another horrible idea,
but...

922
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:33,955
I know an M.C. In Savannah.

923
00:41:43,866 --> 00:41:44,966
Gentlemen.
Hey.

924
00:41:44,967 --> 00:41:46,434
How can I be of service?

925
00:41:46,435 --> 00:41:48,770
Uh, is Rome in tonight?

926
00:41:48,771 --> 00:41:50,438
Are you a member, sir?

927
00:41:50,439 --> 00:41:51,873
N-no.
Not a...

928
00:41:51,874 --> 00:41:54,742
No, we're not members.

929
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:57,845
Uh... I used to...

930
00:41:57,846 --> 00:42:01,483
I used to dance here...
Before it was this.

931
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:03,451
Can you just do me a favor
and...

932
00:42:03,452 --> 00:42:05,720
Just if you could get my name to Rome.

933
00:42:05,721 --> 00:42:06,821
Mike Lane.

934
00:42:06,822 --> 00:42:08,856
And if... and if that doesn't do
the trick,

935
00:42:08,857 --> 00:42:12,194
I guess we'll just stop
bothering you.

936
00:42:15,898 --> 00:42:17,632
You can follow me.

937
00:42:17,633 --> 00:42:20,067
Uh, y'all chill down here.

938
00:42:20,068 --> 00:42:21,437
I'll be back.

939
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:36,885
What's up?

940
00:43:17,159 --> 00:43:20,195
Sit your ass down.

941
00:43:24,867 --> 00:43:27,469
Malik, I'm sorry
for the surprise,

942
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:29,604
but a ghost is a ghost.

943
00:43:29,605 --> 00:43:32,207
I'll see you downstairs
in a minute, okay?

944
00:43:33,309 --> 00:43:35,877
So, they said
"Mike Lane and company."

945
00:43:35,878 --> 00:43:37,412
Mm-hmm.

946
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:39,347
Who's your company?

947
00:43:39,348 --> 00:43:42,016
It's what's left
of the kings of Tampa.

948
00:43:42,017 --> 00:43:43,618
Oh, let me guess.

949
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:47,689
Mr. Crocodile Dundee
done did a little Houdini act?

950
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,957
Yep.

951
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:52,328
Mm-hmm.
Seems so.

952
00:43:53,796 --> 00:43:55,430
Just so you know,

953
00:43:55,431 --> 00:43:59,066
I got out on my own accord
three years ago.

954
00:43:59,067 --> 00:44:01,970
But yet here you are.

955
00:44:03,572 --> 00:44:06,240
You got my curiosity, Mike.

956
00:44:06,241 --> 00:44:08,344
Floor is yours.

957
00:44:09,612 --> 00:44:10,812
No.

958
00:44:10,813 --> 00:44:12,647
I was just in the neighborhood
and wanted to see

959
00:44:12,648 --> 00:44:15,450
if I could stop by and borrow
a cup of brown sugar.

960
00:44:16,785 --> 00:44:20,254
Boy, I tell you,
shit don't change, huh?

961
00:44:20,255 --> 00:44:21,756
Always got to lead with a joke

962
00:44:21,757 --> 00:44:23,791
before you ask
for what you want.

963
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,394
No.

964
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:28,963
So, what did you do,

965
00:44:28,964 --> 00:44:32,334
turn this place into some sort
of a country club or something?

966
00:44:32,335 --> 00:44:33,768
Guess you could say that.

967
00:44:33,769 --> 00:44:36,471
You know, back in the day
in the Roman empire,

968
00:44:36,472 --> 00:44:39,240
as long as you paid the emperor
your taxes,

969
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:40,708
you could worship
who you wanted,

970
00:44:40,709 --> 00:44:42,510
where you wanted,
how you wanted.

971
00:44:42,511 --> 00:44:44,912
Freedom had a small price.

972
00:44:44,913 --> 00:44:48,015
Do you know what people value
more than freedom, Mike?

973
00:44:48,016 --> 00:44:49,617
Please say strippers.

974
00:44:49,618 --> 00:44:50,419
Nope.

975
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,320
Beauty.

976
00:44:52,321 --> 00:44:56,290
So, if beauty is something
you really wish to behold,

977
00:44:56,291 --> 00:45:00,562
you can behold all the beauty
you want right here.

978
00:45:00,563 --> 00:45:04,332
All I ask is for
a little monthly fee, you know?

979
00:45:05,834 --> 00:45:11,806
So it's a subscription-based
pleasure that you're selling?

980
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,542
You got it.

981
00:45:15,544 --> 00:45:17,979
Why don't you let me
show you around?

982
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:19,080
See what we do here.

983
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:21,315
Maybe you'll learn
a little something.

00:49:33,535 --> 00:49:35,036
Just beautiful.

1054
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:38,239
All right, ladies,
you having a good time tonight?

1055
00:49:40,976 --> 00:49:42,977
That's what I thought.

1056
00:49:42,978 --> 00:49:46,147
But you know there's always
a queen up in here

1057
00:49:46,148 --> 00:49:49,851
who must be reminded
of how beautiful she is.

1058
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:51,753
Don't be shy.
Where you at?

1059
00:49:51,754 --> 00:49:54,555
Oop!
Boom.

1060
00:49:54,556 --> 00:49:56,457
There you go.

1061
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,593
Give me your hand.

1062
00:49:59,762 --> 00:50:02,664
Do you know how beautiful
you are?

1063
00:50:02,665 --> 00:50:04,398
Queens, ain't she beautiful?

1064
00:50:07,169 --> 00:50:09,136
You hear that?
But you know what?

1065
00:50:09,137 --> 00:50:11,038
If you're not gonna take
our word for it,

1066
00:50:11,039 --> 00:50:13,908
we're just gonna show you, okay?

1067
00:50:13,909 --> 00:50:20,982
So let me present to you
the absolutely adorable...

1068
00:50:20,983 --> 00:50:22,249
Andre.

1069
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:25,654
What's your name?

1070
00:50:26,789 --> 00:50:28,856
Caroline.

1071
00:50:28,857 --> 00:50:31,292
Don't be shy.
That's a beautiful name.

1072
00:50:31,293 --> 00:50:33,394
It was my grandmother's.

1073
00:50:33,395 --> 00:50:34,796
What did she do?

1074
00:50:34,797 --> 00:50:38,800
Um, she was the first female
black grocery owner

1075
00:50:38,801 --> 00:50:39,801
in the state.

1076
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:41,168
Mm.
A strong woman.

1077
00:50:41,169 --> 00:50:44,638
What brings you to Domina?
Other than the obvious.

1078
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,507
Celebrating my divorce.

1079
00:50:46,508 --> 00:50:48,976
Your girlfriends brought you out
to have a good time, huh?

1080
00:50:48,977 --> 00:50:50,611
Whoo! Yeah.
Good job. Okay.

1081
00:50:50,612 --> 00:50:52,046
I'll take it from here.

1082
00:50:52,047 --> 00:50:54,982
Uh, Caroline,
would you mind...

1083
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:57,384
Sitting for me right here?

1084
00:50:57,385 --> 00:50:58,986
That would be great.

1085
00:50:58,987 --> 00:51:01,222
And, um,
one last thing...

1086
00:51:01,223 --> 00:51:04,425
What's your favorite thing?

1087
00:51:04,426 --> 00:51:05,559
Alcohol.

1088
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:06,828
Alcohol.

1089
00:51:06,829 --> 00:51:08,896
Okay.
Alcohol.

1090
00:51:08,897 --> 00:51:11,799
Um, I'm gonna need some
crowd participation on this one,

1091
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,334
so just, uh,
follow my lead.

1092
00:51:13,335 --> 00:51:15,569
Yeah.

1093
00:51:15,570 --> 00:51:17,604
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

1094
00:51:17,605 --> 00:51:19,106
Okay.

1095
00:51:19,107 --> 00:51:21,944
Mm.

1096
00:51:23,445 --> 00:51:26,180
Young Caroline,
give a Nigga happy time.

1097
00:51:26,181 --> 00:51:28,515
She like alcohol, but you ain't
here to hear me whine.

1098
00:51:28,516 --> 00:51:31,318
I'm looking at your backside.
I'm trying to stay patient.

1099
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,055
Make that thing clap.
That's a standing ovation.

1100
00:51:34,056 --> 00:51:36,257
Grandma independent.
She don't need your help.

1101
00:51:36,258 --> 00:51:39,460
But you don't really feel
that way about yourself.

1102
00:51:39,461 --> 00:51:41,763
That's why the name feel funny
in your mouth.

1103
00:51:41,764 --> 00:51:43,430
You don't believe it,
but I can see it.

1104
00:51:43,431 --> 00:51:45,466
And fuck that dude.
He don't get you.

1105
00:51:45,467 --> 00:51:47,334
I know you're cool
and I just met you.

1106
00:51:47,335 --> 00:51:48,602
Pick you up around 8:00.

1107
00:51:48,603 --> 00:51:50,004
I can come and get you.

1108
00:51:50,005 --> 00:51:51,705
On the coast,
and we ballin' back and forth

1109
00:51:51,706 --> 00:51:54,008
like it's ping-pong
and you ain't got a thing on.

1110
00:51:54,009 --> 00:51:55,676

1126
00:53:01,910 --> 00:53:03,277
I don't know.

1127
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:08,183
Me and the guys were, uh...
We were near Savannah.

1128
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:11,553
And I couldn't not see you.

1129
00:53:16,158 --> 00:53:17,860
Okay.

1130
00:53:19,227 --> 00:53:20,562
And?

1131
00:53:21,763 --> 00:53:23,297
Don't laugh.

1132
00:53:23,298 --> 00:53:26,533
Uh, we're going up to the
convention and... I don't know.

1133
00:53:26,534 --> 00:53:30,438
We're gonna have one crazy night
to put this in bed and...

1134
00:53:32,841 --> 00:53:35,878
I don't know.
I just thought it could be fun.

1135
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:39,180
The convention?

1136
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:42,283
So you mean to tell me you came
all the way here to see me

1137
00:53:42,284 --> 00:53:44,218
about that bullshit convention?

1138
00:53:44,219 --> 00:53:46,287
No.
Look... look, I know.

1139
00:53:46,288 --> 00:53:50,858
I just thought it...
Presented itself as an...

1140
00:53:50,859 --> 00:53:53,060
As an interesting opportunity
for us to...

1141
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:54,728
No, no, no, no.
No.

1142
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:56,530
For you maybe.

1143
00:53:56,531 --> 00:53:58,900
What the hell do I need
a convention for, Mike?

1144
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:00,734
You don't.
That's not what I'm saying.

1145
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:03,404
Would you let me finish, please?
Will you just... no. Unh-Unh. No.

1146
00:54:03,405 --> 00:54:05,106
I haven't talked to you
for eight years

1147
00:54:05,107 --> 00:54:07,541
since you walked out on me.
Oh, did I walk out on you?

1148
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:10,477
Because if I remember correctly,
I went and took a job.

1149
00:54:10,478 --> 00:54:13,114
And when I came back, someone
wouldn't let me in the house.

1150
00:54:13,115 --> 00:54:16,050
Mike, what makes you think
that you can come up in here

1151
00:54:16,051 --> 00:54:18,185
after all this time
and snap your fingers

1152
00:54:18,186 --> 00:54:21,155
and I'm supposed to do a favor
for you?

1153
00:54:21,156 --> 00:54:22,590
Okay.

1154
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:28,695
Maybe... I'm... I'm an idiot.
I'm sorry.

1155
00:54:28,696 --> 00:54:32,599
I-I'm not saying that
at all.

1156
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:33,935
Really?

1157
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:37,038
I don't need a favor from you.

1158
00:54:37,039 --> 00:54:39,473
Fuck the convention.

1159
00:54:39,474 --> 00:54:43,544
Don't...
All it is is an excuse

1160
00:54:43,545 --> 00:54:47,481
for us to try to put
this shit between us to bed.

1161
00:54:47,482 --> 00:54:50,385
That's all.

1162
00:55:06,901 --> 00:55:09,570
Oh, shit.

1163
00:55:12,774 --> 00:55:14,908
Thank you, Octavius.

1164
00:55:14,909 --> 00:55:17,478
Ooh.
You're wonderful.

1165
00:55:17,479 --> 00:55:19,746
My queens, gather.

1166
00:55:19,747 --> 00:55:23,150
I need you.
I need you.

1167
00:55:23,151 --> 00:55:26,253
You ever had a ghost
come to your front door?

1168
00:55:26,254 --> 00:55:29,790
A ghost from your past,
one that still makes you shiver?

1169
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:34,061
I had one today.

1170
00:55:34,062 --> 00:55:36,530
So I need your help.

1171
00:55:36,531 --> 00:55:39,366
I need you
to help me make a decision

1172
00:55:39,367 --> 00:55:42,636
of whether I should leave
that ghost in his grave

1173
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:45,772
or give him an opportunity
to be resurrected.

1174
00:55:45,773 --> 00:55:47,708
Resurrected!

1175
00:55:47,709 --> 00:55:49,610
Okay.

1176
00:55:49,611 --> 00:55:52,113
I got a little treat for y'all
tonight.

1177
00:55:52,114 --> 00:55:58,552
It's a man I knew...
As white chocolate.

1178
00:56:02,057 --> 00:56:06,227
Some might know him
as Magic Mike.

1179
00:56:09,631 --> 00:56:12,799
We're gonna see if he's still
got some magic in that Mike.

1180
00:56:19,907 --> 00:56:22,209
Hello, beautiful.

1181
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:24,311
You down for a little fun
tonight?

1182
00:56:24,312 --> 00:56:26,147
Yes.
All right.

1183
00:56:26,148 --> 00:56:28,583
Have a seat.

1184
00:56:29,717 --> 00:56:31,185
Mike?

1185
00:56:31,186 --> 00:56:33,454
Come on.
Let's not do this.

1186
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:35,389
Uh...

1187
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:37,124
Mnh-mnh.

1188
00:56:37,125 --> 00:56:38,125

00:59:29,831 --> 00:59:32,366
I have Andre over here
to take care of you.

1242
00:59:32,367 --> 00:59:34,034
He'll take you
wherever you want to go.

1243
00:59:34,035 --> 00:59:37,205
Yeah.
We got to get on the road.

1244
00:59:39,774 --> 00:59:42,276
This was, uh,
this was fun...

1245
00:59:42,277 --> 00:59:45,780
Whatever, I guess,
that this was.

1246
00:59:48,383 --> 00:59:50,251
It was good seeing you.

1247
00:59:50,252 --> 00:59:51,485
Likewise.

1248
00:59:51,486 --> 00:59:55,456
So... what was that?

1249
00:59:55,457 --> 00:59:57,958
Y'all used to dance together?

1250
00:59:57,959 --> 00:59:59,326
Uh, yeah.

1251
00:59:59,327 --> 01:00:01,027
Look, it's a...

1252
01:00:01,028 --> 01:00:04,765
It's a long, long story, but,
uh, Rome and I met each other

1253
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:07,000
at a very interesting time
in our lives,

1254
01:00:07,001 --> 01:00:10,371
and... and, uh, I guess you
could say that we had a thing.

1255
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:13,674
Mm. Yeah.
I'd say you had a thing.

1256
01:00:13,675 --> 01:00:14,908
Yeah.

1257
01:00:14,909 --> 01:00:19,012
Well, until I, uh,
I went to work with Dallas.

1258
01:00:19,013 --> 01:00:20,614
Yeah.

1259
01:00:20,615 --> 01:00:24,418
So... is she gonna come help us
or what?

1260
01:00:24,419 --> 01:00:26,019
No.
No.

1261
01:00:26,020 --> 01:00:28,555
I don't... I don't think
that's gonna actually happen.

1262
01:00:28,556 --> 01:00:31,124
Rome likes to stay
in her castle.

1263
01:00:31,125 --> 01:00:33,494
That's why she built it.

1264
01:00:33,495 --> 01:00:36,930
So, uh, I getting on 95 north,
right?

1265
01:00:36,931 --> 01:00:40,334
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just outside of Charleston.

1266
01:00:40,335 --> 01:00:42,469
She texted me the address.
I don't know.

1267
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,371
I'll tell you
when we get closer.

1268
01:00:44,372 --> 01:00:46,172
You need a co-pilot?
Yes, please.

1269
01:00:46,173 --> 01:00:48,475
Okay.

1270
01:00:48,476 --> 01:00:50,877
That was insane tonight, man.

1271
01:00:50,878 --> 01:00:53,514
Thanks. I'm serious, dude.
That was like...

1272
01:00:53,515 --> 01:00:55,349
It was a good night.
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1273
01:00:55,350 --> 01:00:56,850
Your stuff is revolutionary,
man.

1274
01:00:56,851 --> 01:00:58,552
Sometimes the songs
are a little...

1275
01:00:58,553 --> 01:01:00,587
No, man. It was perfect.
Are you kidding me?

1276
01:01:00,588 --> 01:01:03,023
I appreciate that. And you
just made that up on the spot.

1277
01:01:03,024 --> 01:01:05,859
I... well, Rome likes us
to put our passion in our work.

1278
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:06,860
Well, it shows, man.

1279
01:01:06,861 --> 01:01:08,962
I've never seen anything
like that.

1280
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:11,832
Are you doing anything else
with your music?

1281
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:14,134
Man, I'm trying.
I put it up online.

1282
01:01:14,135 --> 01:01:16,970
Hopefully, like, it'll spread
through social media,

1283
01:01:16,971 --> 01:01:19,940
but honestly, with this E.P.
That's coming out, it's...

1284
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:21,207
Oh, cool, man.

1285
01:01:21,208 --> 01:01:23,276
It's hard to get people
to pay attention to it.

1286
01:01:23,277 --> 01:01:26,580
'Cause there's so much shit that comes
on the Internet every day. Oh. So much.

1287
01:01:26,581 --> 01:01:28,281
I just want to stay authentic.

1288
01:01:28,282 --> 01:01:30,484
Yeah. Well,
at least you're trying, man.

1289
01:01:30,485 --> 01:01:31,985
At least you're trying.

1290
01:01:31,986 --> 01:01:34,287
That's why I moved
down to Florida back in the day,

1291
01:01:34,288 --> 01:01:35,656
actually,
was to do music stuff.

1292
01:01:35,657 --> 01:01:37,424
Really?
Yeah. Yeah.

1293
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:39,225
I sang
in "Dream along with Mickey"

1294
01:01:39,226 --> 01:01:40,927
at Disney world from '03 to '05.

1295
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:42,162
What?

1296
01:01:42,163 --> 01:01:43,564
Yeah, man.
For real.

1297
01:01:43,565 --> 01:01:45,198
I mean, I started out
as the Donald duck understudy,

1298
01:01:45,199 --> 01:01:48,402
but I... I was playing Mickey
by my second year.

1299
01:01:48,403 --> 01:01:50,804
I got signed by an agent,

1300
01:01:50,805 --> 01:01:53,607
booked a couple
regional commercial spots.

1301
01:01:53,608 --> 01:01:56,410
And one day I heard an ad on
the radio looking for dancers.

1302
01:01:56,411 --> 01:01:58,345
And you know how that shit goes,
so...

1303
01:01:58,346 --> 01:02:01,047
When I started this,
I thought...

1304
01:02:01,048 --> 01:02:03,016
Man, I thought I'd hate it.

1305
01:02:03,017 --> 01:02:06,853
But now, if the... if, like,
the E.P. Blew up tomorrow,

1306
01:02:06,854 --> 01:02:09,356
I'd probably still do this
on the side.

1307
01:02:09,357 --> 01:02:10,357
What?
I'm serious.

1308
01:02:10,358 --> 01:02:11,658
You're shitting me.

1309
01:02:11,659 --> 01:02:14,661
Do you see how many girls I meet
every day?

1310
01:02:14,662 --> 01:02:16,430
Yes.
For free?

1311
01:02:16,431 --> 01:02:18,231
For free!
I don't got to pay for...

1312
01:02:18,232 --> 01:02:19,232
All I do is sing.

1313
01:02:19,233 --> 01:02:20,767
And you think about that.

1314
01:02:20,768 --> 01:02:23,970
Like, these girls have to deal
with men in their lives

1315
01:02:23,971 --> 01:02:26,507
every day who...
They don't listen to them.

1316
01:02:26,508 --> 01:02:28,074
They don't ask them
what they want.

1317
01:02:28,075 --> 01:02:30,010
They don't even ask them
what they want.

1318
01:02:30,011 --> 01:02:32,178
All we got to do is ask them
what they want.

1319
01:02:32,179 --> 01:02:34,214
And when they tell you,
it's a beautiful thing, man.

1320
01:02:34,215 --> 01:02:38,284
It's like we're like...
We're like healers or something.

1321
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:40,387
Yes, man.

1322
01:02:40,388 --> 01:02:41,688
Fuck, yes.
We are.

1323
01:02:41,689 --> 01:02:43,424
That's right.
We're healers.

1324
01:02:43,425 --> 01:02:45,091
We're healers, man.

1325
01:02:45,092 --> 01:02:47,160
We can be.
Okay. Yeah. We can be.

1326
01:02:47,161 --> 01:02:48,929
We can be.

1327
01:02:48,930 --> 01:02:49,930
Okay.
I like that.

1328
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:15,656
Hey, thanks for the ride.
No problem, man.

1329
01:03:15,657 --> 01:03:17,524
Good talking to you, man.
Safe home.

1330
01:03:17,525 --> 01:03:18,992
Look us up
when you get back.

1331
01:03:18,993 --> 01:03:20,461
All right, man.
Thanks, man.

1332
01:03:20,462 --> 01:03:22,128
You sure this is the place?

1333
01:03:22,129 --> 01:03:24,865
Yeah. I'm positive.
She said it, and I got the text.

1334
01:03:24,866 --> 01:03:28,101
Looks like somebody hooked up
with a trust fund baby! You know?

1335
01:03:28,102 --> 01:03:30,537
I just hit her
with her favorite flavor, baby,

1336
01:03:30,538 --> 01:03:32,172
and we're livin' large.

1337
01:03:32,173 --> 01:03:34,476
Megan?

1338
01:03:35,543 --> 01:03:37,478
Hello?

1339
01:03:37,479 --> 01:03:39,713
Megan?

1340
01:03:39,714 --> 01:03:41,882
There's some law of attraction
going on up in here.

1341
01:03:41,883 --> 01:03:43,484
There's somebody in here.
Megan!

1342
01:03:43,485 --> 01:03:44,485
It's Tito!

1343
01:03:44,486 --> 01:03:46,152
Hey!

1344
01:03:46,153 --> 01:03:49,089
Oh... shit.

1345
01:03:49,090 --> 01:03:50,691
Who are you?

1346
01:03:50,692 --> 01:03:54,360
Just, uh,
friends of Megan.

1347
01:03:54,361 --> 01:03:56,129
Ah.

1348
01:03:56,130 --> 01:03:57,764
Is Megan here?

1349
01:03:57,765 --> 01:04:01,034
My daughter and her friends
are outside.

1350
01:04:01,035 --> 01:04:02,202
Who are you?

1351
01:04:02,203 --> 01:04:04,070
Oh, you're having a party.
We'll just go out...

1352
01:04:04,071 --> 01:04:06,072
You said Megan was back this way
in the guesthouse?

1353
01:04:06,073 --> 01:04:07,340
You hold on.

1354
01:04:07,341 --> 01:04:10,310
Y'all can't just walk
in my house like strangers

1355
01:04:10,311 --> 01:04:12,278
without having a hello drink.

1356
01:04:13,781 --> 01:04:16,617
You come on now
and have a seat.

1357
01:04:16,618 --> 01:04:19,486
What you want?
You want red? You want white?

1358
01:04:19,487 --> 01:04:21,622
We got whiskey.
We got shine.

1359
01:04:21,623 --> 01:04:23,957
Y'all get something.

1360
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:27,528
How about we start with wine
and end with shine?

1361
01:04:27,529 --> 01:04:29,062
I like that rule.

1362
01:04:29,063 --> 01:04:31,331
Honey, you come sit right here.
Come on.

1363
01:04:31,332 --> 01:04:33,634
Oh, shit!

1364
01:04:33,635 --> 01:04:35,168
Thank you so much.

1365
01:04:35,169 --> 01:04:36,269
It smells good.

1366
01:04:36,270 --> 01:04:38,539
Well... cheers!

1367
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,774
Cheers. Cheers. Eye contact.

1368
01:04:40,775 --> 01:04:43,309
Thank you for your hospitality,
Ma'am.

1369
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,711
Quit that proper shit.

1370
01:04:45,747 --> 01:04:47,848
You sound just like my ex.

1371
01:04:47,849 --> 01:04:50,350
What are your names?

1372
01:04:50,351 --> 01:04:51,852
Uh, I'm Mike.
This is Tito...

1373
01:04:51,853 --> 01:04:52,853
Tito.
...Ken...

1374
01:04:52,854 --> 01:04:54,521
Ken.
...Richie,

1375
01:04:54,522 --> 01:04:56,691
uh...

1376
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:00,727
Ernest.
...Ernest. Ernest.

1377
01:05:00,728 --> 01:05:02,128
Well, I'm Nancy.

1378
01:05:02,129 --> 01:05:06,733
And this is Mae, Julia,
Diane, and Jessica.

1379
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:08,168
Hey.
Nice to meet you.

1380
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:10,203
Nice to meet y'all.
Thank you, ladies.

1381
01:05:10,204 --> 01:05:12,573
Y'all don't look like
you're from around here.

1382
01:05:12,574 --> 01:05:15,475
We're from Miami.
Uh, just...

1383
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:18,679
Florida.

1384
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,346
There's one in Ohio, dude.

1385
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:23,183
Just passing through
on our way to myrtle beach.

1386
01:05:23,184 --> 01:05:25,819
Oh! Myrtle beach!
Redneck Riviera.

1387
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:28,154
Y'all should try kiawah instead.

1388
01:05:28,155 --> 01:05:29,956
Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am.

1389
01:05:29,957 --> 01:05:31,992
"Oh, yeah, I heard
that's real nice, ma'am."

1390
01:05:33,094 --> 01:05:34,595
Listen to him!

1391
01:05:34,596 --> 01:05:36,029
Is that what I sound like?

1392
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:38,732
You're good!

1393
01:05:38,733 --> 01:05:40,266
Don't think I don't know

1394
01:05:40,267 --> 01:05:43,136
what you're doing here
with those girls.

1395
01:05:43,137 --> 01:05:46,840
How do y'all know my daughter?

1396
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:48,709
We just...
Uh, we just met her at a...

1397
01:05:48,710 --> 01:05:51,077
At a... in Jacksonville at...
At a...

1398
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:52,013
It was a bar.

1399
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:54,581
A bar.
Well, that's my daughter.

1400
01:05:54,582 --> 01:05:56,583
Always making new friends!

1401
01:05:58,853 --> 01:06:01,454
So what do y'all do?

1402
01:06:01,455 --> 01:06:03,690
We are...
I, uh... hey!

1403
01:06:03,691 --> 01:06:04,725
How are you?

1404
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:05,726
Hey!
Hi!

1405
01:06:05,727 --> 01:06:06,960
There you are.

1406
01:06:06,961 --> 01:06:08,929
Hey.
What are y'all talking about?

1407
01:06:08,930 --> 01:06:10,731
Oh, the boys
are just about to tell us

1408
01:06:10,732 --> 01:06:12,733
what they do for a living.
Oh.

1409
01:06:12,734 --> 01:06:14,200
Mm-hmm.

1410
01:06:14,201 --> 01:06:16,970
We, uh...

1411
01:06:16,971 --> 01:06:19,305
What do... uh, I have...

1412
01:06:19,306 --> 01:06:20,540
I have my own furniture company.

1413
01:06:20,541 --> 01:06:22,508
Yeah. He's great.
Um...

1414
01:06:22,509 --> 01:06:25,846
Tito here is into yogurt.

1415
01:06:25,847 --> 01:06:28,882
Frozen yogurt.
Yeah. artisanal.

1416
01:06:28,883 --> 01:06:34,988
Ken is a budding actor and, um,
and level-3 reiki healer.

1417
01:06:34,989 --> 01:06:37,023
Uh, so if you need any work
done...

1418
01:06:37,024 --> 01:06:40,560
Uh, Ernie is...
Is an artist.

1419
01:06:40,561 --> 01:06:41,828
He's a painter.

1420
01:06:41,829 --> 01:06:44,497
Mom, they're male strippers.

1421
01:06:44,498 --> 01:06:46,299
Now, that makes sense.

1422
01:06:46,300 --> 01:06:48,869
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1423
01:06:48,870 --> 01:06:52,238
Because it's fucking awkward
to do somebody like that.

1424
01:06:52,239 --> 01:06:55,241
Enough with that fucking language!

1425
01:06:55,242 --> 01:06:57,143
Oh, God, I don't think
I've ever had

1426
01:06:57,144 --> 01:06:59,212
a real live stripper
in my house before.

1427
01:06:59,213 --> 01:07:00,546
You have now.

1428
01:07:00,547 --> 01:07:02,515
Uh, well, actually,
the... the technical term is...

1429
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:04,550
Is male entertainer.
Oh, my!

1430
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:07,587
Mom, they're not here for that.
They're just friends.

1431
01:07:07,588 --> 01:07:09,422
Of course not!

1432
01:07:09,423 --> 01:07:13,059
Shit, Diana, go down
and grab us some more Vino.

1433
01:07:13,060 --> 01:07:15,295
No, no, no.
Don't... don't you worry.

1434
01:07:15,296 --> 01:07:18,131
I got this. I'll reload, Nancy.
Okay, baby.

1435
01:07:18,132 --> 01:07:21,367
You just... you just get
anything that looks expensive.

1436
01:07:21,368 --> 01:07:22,669
As much of the good stuff

1437
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,304
as your little arms can carry,
darling.

1438
01:07:24,305 --> 01:07:26,406
You got it.

1439
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:28,541
I-I got arms.
I'll help.

1440
01:07:34,515 --> 01:07:37,150
Are you native American, Tito?

1441
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:41,587
Yes, on my mother's side.

1442
01:07:41,588 --> 01:07:44,057
Really, I've got it.
Thanks, though.

1443
01:07:44,058 --> 01:07:45,992
Oh, you do not have it.

1444
01:07:45,993 --> 01:07:48,128
By what I just saw up there,

1445
01:07:48,129 --> 01:07:52,265
we are gonna need a fucking
pack mule to water that bunch.

1446
01:07:52,266 --> 01:07:54,334
So... I don't know.

1447
01:07:54,335 --> 01:07:56,469
Let's fucking do this.

1448
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:58,972
I thought you were supposed to
be in New York, by the way.

1449
01:07:58,973 --> 01:08:01,307
Oh, wait.
Is that not where we are?

1450
01:08:01,308 --> 01:08:02,910
Wow.

1451
01:08:04,445 --> 01:08:06,780
Hmm?

1452
01:08:06,781 --> 01:08:08,916
I changed my mind.

1453
01:08:10,217 --> 01:08:12,118
So does that mean
you are gonna be on the pole

1454
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,720
or you're not gonna be
on the pole?

1455
01:08:13,721 --> 01:08:15,155
Because, I mean,

1456
01:08:15,156 --> 01:08:17,190
"Dolly Titz on the main stage,
coming up for you, boys.

1457
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:19,760
Get your dollar bills out
and let's brighten up her day"

1458
01:08:19,761 --> 01:08:22,062
sounds awesome to me.

1459
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:23,396
Ha ha.

1460
01:08:23,397 --> 01:08:25,932
Nice callback, Clitoria.

1461
01:08:25,933 --> 01:08:28,769
It's low-hanging fruit.
I can't help myself.

1462
01:08:28,770 --> 01:08:30,470
What's the plan now, then?

1463
01:08:30,471 --> 01:08:32,538
Currently?
Yep.

1464
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:36,409
Find the perfect dynamite
for that powder keg upstairs

1465
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:39,712
and... watch it blow.

1466
01:08:39,713 --> 01:08:41,614
Okay.

1467
01:08:41,615 --> 01:08:43,216
What are we looking for?

1468
01:08:43,217 --> 01:08:48,421
Something old and expensive...
To fit in upstairs.

1469
01:08:48,422 --> 01:08:50,091
Cool.

1470
01:08:51,125 --> 01:08:53,293
They all look the same to me.

1471
01:08:53,294 --> 01:08:55,396
Racist.

1472
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:58,731
Hmm?

1473
01:08:58,732 --> 01:09:02,335
1959 Château Lafite.

1474
01:09:02,336 --> 01:09:03,204
That'll do.

1475
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:04,570
You see, what I hear

1476
01:09:04,571 --> 01:09:08,942
is that guy isn't taking care
of his own shit.

1477
01:09:08,943 --> 01:09:11,411
How are you gonna expect
your lady to trim the hedges,

1478
01:09:11,412 --> 01:09:15,348
if you're not willing to...
Prune the tree?

1479
01:09:17,251 --> 01:09:20,320
See, I have a three-day
Max-Growth rule.

1480
01:09:20,321 --> 01:09:23,189
- Really?
- Abso-fucking-lutely, ma'am.

1481
01:09:23,190 --> 01:09:24,190
Wow.

1482
01:09:24,191 --> 01:09:26,292
Pardon my language.
Oh, please.

1483
01:09:26,293 --> 01:09:27,627
We got wine!

1484
01:09:29,063 --> 01:09:30,130
A basket full of wine!

1485
01:09:30,131 --> 01:09:31,731
We got a basket of wine.

1486
01:09:31,732 --> 01:09:35,101
You are missing out
on some husband tales in here.

1487
01:09:35,102 --> 01:09:36,502
Or ex-husband tales.

1488
01:09:36,503 --> 01:09:38,638
Julia and I are trying to lure
Mae and Diana

1489
01:09:38,639 --> 01:09:40,740
over to the dark side.

1490
01:09:40,741 --> 01:09:43,009
Use the force, Nance.

1491
01:09:43,010 --> 01:09:45,078
Come on, Mae.

1492
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,813
It's your turn.

1493
01:09:46,814 --> 01:09:49,015
Come on, Mae.

1494
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:50,650
Come on, Mae.

1495
01:09:50,651 --> 01:09:54,587
We know it ain't all peaches
and roses in that bedroom.

1496
01:09:54,588 --> 01:09:56,622
Cone of silence here.

1497
01:09:56,623 --> 01:09:59,659
Fine.
I'll go, then.

1498
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,328
Ugh.
Here's a whopper for you.

1499
01:10:02,329 --> 01:10:03,496
Here we go.

1500
01:10:03,497 --> 01:10:06,499
Roger's the only man
I've ever slept with.

1501
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:08,701
Then you are gonna get
more wine.

1502
01:10:10,804 --> 01:10:12,472
Yeah.

1503
01:10:12,473 --> 01:10:17,177
I lost my virginity to him when
I was 17, and that was that.

1504
01:10:17,178 --> 01:10:19,212
Two beautiful daughters,

1505
01:10:19,213 --> 01:10:23,183
but only one penis
my entire fucking life.

1506
01:10:23,184 --> 01:10:28,621
Sadly, I was too naive to
recognize that he was a gay man.

1507
01:10:28,622 --> 01:10:30,590
Mom,
you don't know that.

1508
01:10:30,591 --> 01:10:31,958
Oh, I knew enough.

1509
01:10:31,959 --> 01:10:33,426
I knew he really liked it
when I put my fing...

1510
01:10:33,427 --> 01:10:35,128
Mom! No. I don't want to hear that.
Hey!

1511
01:10:35,129 --> 01:10:37,230
Well, you need to hear this!
It's not so terrible.

1512
01:10:37,231 --> 01:10:40,533
Because I pissed away
all of this on one man.

1513
01:10:40,534 --> 01:10:43,336
And you are not gonna make
the same mistake.

1514
01:10:43,337 --> 01:10:44,604
Got it.

1515
01:10:44,605 --> 01:10:49,242
That's why I tell these girls
to play the field.

1516
01:10:49,243 --> 01:10:52,545
And don't stop
until you find one

1517
01:10:52,546 --> 01:10:56,149
that rocks
your fucking socks off!

1518
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:57,850
My Motto.
Hear, hear.

1519
01:10:57,851 --> 01:11:01,487
Well, you know, Nancy,
that plays both ways.

1520
01:11:01,488 --> 01:11:05,525
I think I've had
as good a run as anybody.

1521
01:11:05,526 --> 01:11:07,293
But I'd trade all that
in a heartbeat

1522
01:11:07,294 --> 01:11:11,464
to come home to a wife, a kid,
people that love me.

1523
01:11:11,465 --> 01:11:15,735
That hole is never
gonna be filled.

1524
01:11:15,736 --> 01:11:18,205
That ship fucking sailed.

1525
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:23,443
Wow.

1526
01:11:23,444 --> 01:11:25,979
I think my soul just died
a little bit.

1527
01:11:25,980 --> 01:11:28,281
I love you, Ernie.

1528
01:11:28,282 --> 01:11:31,651
Well, Hank and I have never had
sex with the lights on.

1529
01:11:31,652 --> 01:11:33,253
What?

1530
01:11:33,254 --> 01:11:36,156
Every time it starts,
he just goes and turns 'em off.

1531
01:11:36,157 --> 01:11:39,960
And I try to drop hints,
but, um...

1532
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:42,162
Maybe it's me.
I don't know.

1533
01:11:42,163 --> 01:11:44,630
Come on. Never once?

1534
01:11:44,631 --> 01:11:46,499
Never.

1535
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,969
He's not showing you
how beautiful you are.

1536
01:11:48,970 --> 01:11:50,870
No. You're gorgeous...
You know that, right?

1537
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:52,138
She's gorgeous, right?

1538
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:54,040
And I'm not just talking
about the paint job.

1539
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,908
I'm not talking about
this vessel.

1540
01:11:55,909 --> 01:11:57,843
I'm talking about
what's inside you.

1541
01:11:57,844 --> 01:11:59,412
I read energy in my work,

1542
01:11:59,413 --> 01:12:06,586
and... and yours is pure and
sweet and loving and nurturing.

1543
01:12:06,587 --> 01:12:07,521
You got to talk to him.

1544
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:09,089
'Cause if he's not gonna
worship you,

1545
01:12:09,090 --> 01:12:10,290
there's a lot of guys out there
who will.

1546
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:12,058
And the line starts right here.

1547
01:12:12,059 --> 01:12:13,593
Winds around this room, too.
Yep. Absolutely.

1548
01:12:13,594 --> 01:12:14,760
You know that, right?

1549
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:17,697
Good. Don't... no, no.
Don't get shy on me.

1550
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:19,799
You need to say it.
I want to hear you say it.

1551
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:22,102
Own it.

1552
01:12:22,103 --> 01:12:24,704
Well, I just don't know
what to say to him.

1553
01:12:24,705 --> 01:12:26,572
Well, tell him
what your fantasy is.

1554
01:12:26,573 --> 01:12:28,708
And make sure he does it
with the lights on.

1555
01:12:28,709 --> 01:12:32,578
If he doesn't, then y'all have
a serious problem.

1556
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:34,780
Well, I, um...

1557
01:12:34,781 --> 01:12:37,683
When we were in college
and we were falling in love,

1558
01:12:37,684 --> 01:12:41,587
we used to listen to that song,
um, "heaven."

1559
01:12:41,588 --> 01:12:43,923
Oh, shit.
Yes!

1560
01:12:43,924 --> 01:12:45,725
I love that song.

1561
01:12:45,726 --> 01:12:49,129
♪ Oh, thinking about
all our younger years ♪

1562
01:12:50,464 --> 01:12:53,699
♪ There was only you and me ♪

1563
01:12:53,700 --> 01:12:57,370
♪ We were young and wild
and free ♪

1564
01:12:57,371 --> 01:12:59,372

That's wonderful!

1579
01:13:44,585 --> 01:13:47,120
I don't think
Hank can do that.

1580
01:13:48,889 --> 01:13:50,556
Doctor's in the house,
baby.

1581
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:53,559
The doctor has checked
into the building.

1582
01:13:53,560 --> 01:13:54,960
Oh, thank you.

1583
01:13:54,961 --> 01:13:57,263
Yeah!
Fuck, Ken!

1584
01:13:57,264 --> 01:13:59,065
What the fuck?

1585
01:13:59,066 --> 01:14:01,167
Y'all know
that was my audition song.

1586
01:14:01,168 --> 01:14:03,069
What?
Yeah, it was one of them.

1587
01:14:04,971 --> 01:14:07,273
It's awesome.

1588
01:14:07,274 --> 01:14:11,944
Oh, God,
I just love this fucking night!

1589
01:14:11,945 --> 01:14:14,547
I love it!

1590
01:14:14,548 --> 01:14:18,718
I wish we had known you guys
back in our day, you know?

1591
01:14:18,719 --> 01:14:22,122
Well, I'd say
it's still your day, ma'am.

1592
01:14:24,057 --> 01:14:26,227
Thank you, Richie.

1593
01:14:28,829 --> 01:14:30,663
Stand up.

1594
01:14:30,664 --> 01:14:33,533
- Oh, no.
- Come on, stand up.

1595
01:14:33,534 --> 01:14:34,600
Hey!

1596
01:14:38,139 --> 01:14:40,340
Oh, my God.
Just look at you.

1597
01:14:40,341 --> 01:14:42,542
You are just perfect.

1598
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:43,776
Damn!

1599
01:14:45,946 --> 01:14:47,347
Oh, God.

1600
01:14:47,348 --> 01:14:48,881
- Oh, damn, look at you.
- Here it comes.

1601
01:14:48,882 --> 01:14:51,851
I hate to be rude, but...

1602
01:14:51,852 --> 01:14:53,119
You want to pop the hood.

1603
01:14:57,158 --> 01:15:00,092
Oh, shit.

1604
01:15:00,093 --> 01:15:01,927
Oh, my God!

1605
01:15:01,928 --> 01:15:04,297
- Mom!
- Oh, please!

1606
01:15:04,298 --> 01:15:06,766
Of course you're...
You're eating cake by yourself

1607
01:15:06,767 --> 01:15:09,335
when, uh, the fireworks
are about to go off in there.

1608
01:15:09,336 --> 01:15:11,070
This isn't concerning at all.

1609
01:15:11,071 --> 01:15:13,038
What can I say?

1610
01:15:13,039 --> 01:15:14,907
I like cake.

1611
01:15:14,908 --> 01:15:18,578
Do you have any idea
what's going on out there?

1612
01:15:18,579 --> 01:15:20,546
A lady is about to get...

1613
01:15:20,547 --> 01:15:22,882
I don't even know
how to put it into words.

1614
01:15:22,883 --> 01:15:24,784
No.
I'm a cookie guy.

1615
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:26,252
What?

1616
01:15:26,253 --> 01:15:28,854
Yeah.
It's red fucking velvet.

1617
01:15:28,855 --> 01:15:31,424
I would take a pack of oreos
over that bullshit

1618
01:15:31,425 --> 01:15:33,326
any day of the week.
What's wrong with you?

1619
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:34,827
Nothing's wrong.
'Cause cookies are awesome.

1620
01:15:34,828 --> 01:15:36,729
Well, I don't think
we have anything more

1621
01:15:36,730 --> 01:15:38,063
to say to one another.

1622
01:15:38,064 --> 01:15:40,366
Look, if you don't want to talk
about it or whatever...

1623
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:41,667
I don't know
if it's about New York...

1624
01:15:41,668 --> 01:15:43,569
But I maybe intuit
that it might be...

1625
01:15:43,570 --> 01:15:46,572
I'm gonna start hiding
the kitchen knives in a minute.

1626
01:15:46,573 --> 01:15:48,841
Seriously, it is that obvious.

1627
01:15:48,842 --> 01:15:51,144
What's up?

1628
01:15:52,579 --> 01:15:57,350
I met a photographer in Miami
at this party I was working at.

1629
01:15:57,351 --> 01:16:00,152
He was nice and married
and all of that.

1630
01:16:00,153 --> 01:16:01,454
Mm.

1631
01:16:01,455 --> 01:16:05,958
Took a look at my photos
and said I had an eye.

1632
01:16:05,959 --> 01:16:09,262
Offered me a job right there
on the spot as his assistant.

1633
01:16:09,263 --> 01:16:10,663
That's cool.

1634
01:16:10,664 --> 01:16:13,132
I mean, did he offer a place
for you to stay as well

1635
01:16:13,133 --> 01:16:16,035
that happened to be his house
when his wife was away?

1636
01:16:16,036 --> 01:16:17,169
That...

1637
01:16:17,170 --> 01:16:18,871
Yeah.

1638
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:20,273
Wait.
Were you there?

1639
01:16:20,274 --> 01:16:22,742
I was there, but I was in drag.
You wouldn't have recognized me.

1640
01:16:22,743 --> 01:16:26,646
Mm. But I just want to throw
this out there, though.

1641
01:16:26,647 --> 01:16:28,080
Um, this might be God's way

1642
01:16:28,081 --> 01:16:30,950
of giving you a second chance
at Myrtle Beach.

1643
01:16:30,951 --> 01:16:32,552
Mm.

1644
01:16:32,553 --> 01:16:34,320
Any God worth believing in

1645
01:16:34,321 --> 01:16:37,758
certainly sends you dudes
in thongs when in need.

1646
01:16:39,426 --> 01:16:42,228
Or she just knows
that some asshole in Miami...

1647
01:16:42,229 --> 01:16:43,329
She?

1648
01:16:43,330 --> 01:16:44,797
Yes, my God is a she.

1649
01:16:44,798 --> 01:16:49,902
Um, she just might know that...
I don't know...

1650
01:16:49,903 --> 01:16:53,440
Some asshole in Miami stole your
smile and you need it back.

1651
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:56,642
And I can guarantee you

1652
01:16:56,643 --> 01:17:00,513
that strippers will give
smiles aplenty

1653
01:17:00,514 --> 01:17:02,348
and make you forget
about New York.

1654
01:17:02,349 --> 01:17:06,352
And if that doesn't work, then
there will be 3,000 women there,

1655
01:17:06,353 --> 01:17:09,989
seeing as you're not
in a boy phase.

1656
01:17:09,990 --> 01:17:12,292
That's quite a pitch.
Mm.

1657
01:17:12,293 --> 01:17:13,893
Look, when shit's not going
your way,

1658
01:17:13,894 --> 01:17:16,496
getting a little crazy
with some random friends

1659
01:17:16,497 --> 01:17:19,899
has a way of helping you
sort out your own shit.

1660
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,934
So I'm your friend now?

1661
01:17:21,935 --> 01:17:23,403
You've seen me pee.

1662
01:17:23,404 --> 01:17:26,307
I don't know anyone that's not
my friend that's seen me pee.

1663
01:17:27,841 --> 01:17:29,875
Fair enough.

1664
01:17:29,876 --> 01:17:34,847
Look, I don't normally trust
a cookie guy...

1665
01:17:34,848 --> 01:17:37,317
But I'll...
I'll think about it.

1666
01:17:37,318 --> 01:17:39,319
That's valid.

1667
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:41,587
All right.
You think about it, Dolly.

1668
01:17:41,588 --> 01:17:43,756
I'm gonna go back in there
and feed the Wolves,

1669
01:17:43,757 --> 01:17:45,791
'cause it's getting
a little rabid in there.

1670
01:17:45,792 --> 01:17:47,393
All right?

1671
01:17:47,394 --> 01:17:49,329
It's Zoe, by the way.

1672
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:50,563
Zoe.
Mm-hmm.

1673
01:17:50,564 --> 01:17:51,997
Nice to meet you.

1674
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:53,265
Magic.

1675
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:55,369
Magic Mike.

1676
01:18:24,297 --> 01:18:25,799
Thanks, man.
Yeah.

1677
01:18:30,003 --> 01:18:31,070
Morning, gentlemen.

1678
01:18:31,071 --> 01:18:32,672
Morning.
Hey, buddy.

1679
01:18:32,673 --> 01:18:34,139
Everyone sleep all right?

1680
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,207
Yeah.
Yeah.

1681
01:18:35,208 --> 01:18:37,877
You boys have fun.

1682
01:18:37,878 --> 01:18:40,881
Mm.

1683
01:18:42,148 --> 01:18:45,752
Mm.

1684
01:18:47,220 --> 01:18:49,390
Mm.

1685
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,592
Did you bangee?

1686
01:18:52,593 --> 01:18:54,394
Did you bangee?

1687
01:18:54,395 --> 01:18:55,428
Yes.

1688
01:18:55,429 --> 01:18:56,762
You banged her?

1689
01:18:56,763 --> 01:18:59,032
Was she the glass slipper?

1690
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:01,434
Yes, man!

1691
01:19:01,435 --> 01:19:05,538
That wonderful, nice lady
was the glass slipper?

1692
01:19:05,539 --> 01:19:07,440
Hold it.
Every inch?

1693
01:19:07,441 --> 01:19:09,109
Wow.

1694
01:19:10,411 --> 01:19:11,944
Y'all had a crazy connection,
man.

1695
01:19:11,945 --> 01:19:14,781
I could feel it.
I'm so happy for you.

1696
01:19:16,383 --> 01:19:17,783
What?

1697
01:19:17,784 --> 01:19:19,652
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah. What?!

1698
01:19:19,653 --> 01:19:21,220
You got to be fucking joking.

1699
01:19:21,221 --> 01:19:22,588
Oh, shit!

1700
01:19:22,589 --> 01:19:24,924
This is us?
It was the Ex-husband's.

1701
01:19:24,925 --> 01:19:27,359
Said she didn't care what shape
I brought it back in,

1702
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:28,828
as long as I brought it back.

1703
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:32,364
Didn't realize she'd
been married to Shawn Kemp.

1704
01:19:32,365 --> 01:19:33,699
Pimpin'!
Sweet!

1705
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:36,068
That is a beautiful piece
of machinery, man.

1706
01:19:36,069 --> 01:19:37,503
Holy shit.

1707
01:19:37,504 --> 01:19:39,672
We're gonna kill on the strip in myrtle.
This is nice.

1708
01:19:39,673 --> 01:19:41,173
This is gonna kill.

Gentlemen, welcome.
We've been expecting you.

1720
01:20:52,312 --> 01:20:54,947
Uh, Ms. Davidson called ahead,
upgraded your rooms,

1721
01:20:54,948 --> 01:20:56,882
and booked you
our conference space.

1722
01:20:56,883 --> 01:20:59,384
Oh, what's up, Ms.
Davidson? Yeah.

1723
01:20:59,385 --> 01:21:02,922
Oh, I know what's...
I know what was up Ms. Davidson.

1724
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:06,893
That's sick, man.

1725
01:21:07,928 --> 01:21:10,429
No!
Get outta here!

1726
01:21:10,430 --> 01:21:12,732
Come on, man.

1727
01:21:12,733 --> 01:21:16,101
So you think it's okay to have
me wait for you for two hours?

1728
01:21:16,102 --> 01:21:18,437
No, it's not okay,
but someone should've told me.

1729
01:21:18,438 --> 01:21:19,672
Yo, man.

1730
01:21:19,673 --> 01:21:21,674
Don't say I never did anything
for you.

1731
01:21:21,675 --> 01:21:23,976
I ain't never gonna say that.
I promise you that.

1732
01:21:23,977 --> 01:21:25,344
Look at this!
What's up?

1733
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:26,478
How you doing?

1734
01:21:26,479 --> 01:21:27,647
What's up, man?

1735
01:21:27,648 --> 01:21:28,881
Hi, sweetie.

1736
01:21:28,882 --> 01:21:31,083
So, 3,000 women, man?
3,000 women.

1737
01:21:31,084 --> 01:21:32,018
You got some ideas?

1738
01:21:32,019 --> 01:21:33,418
Yeah,
I got some ideas.

1739
01:21:33,419 --> 01:21:34,687
They ain't ready for you.

1740
01:21:34,688 --> 01:21:36,922

01:23:51,291 --> 01:23:52,424
Later, guys.

1779
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:56,295
Where is your yogurt now, man?
I'm starving.

1780
01:23:56,296 --> 01:23:57,329
Yeah.

1781
01:23:59,232 --> 01:24:00,700
You really think...

1782
01:24:00,701 --> 01:24:02,567
You really think
it's gonna work?

1783
01:24:02,568 --> 01:24:04,303
You think
I can pull this off?

1784
01:24:04,304 --> 01:24:05,570
What, the yogurt truck?

1785
01:24:05,571 --> 01:24:06,571
Yeah.

1786
01:24:06,572 --> 01:24:08,207
Yeah.
Absolutely.

1787
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:09,709
Man, I hope so.

1788
01:24:09,710 --> 01:24:11,143
I hope I can keep it afloat,
man.

1789
01:24:11,144 --> 01:24:13,979
'Cause nothing feels that good.

1790
01:24:13,980 --> 01:24:17,016
Other than being onstage.

1791
01:24:17,017 --> 01:24:18,784
But that's why.
That's why it's gonna work, man.

1792
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:20,552
You love it too much.

1793
01:24:20,553 --> 01:24:24,056
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you.
It's not gonna be easy.

1794
01:24:24,057 --> 01:24:26,425
If you want, man, look,
I'll...

1795
01:24:26,426 --> 01:24:29,729
On the way back down, I'll...
I'll go over everything you got.

1796
01:24:29,730 --> 01:24:31,030
We'll... we'll go through it.

1797
01:24:31,031 --> 01:24:32,431
Yeah?
Yeah.

1798
01:24:32,432 --> 01:24:34,266
That'd be cool, man.

1799
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:40,039
You know,
I get why you left.

1800
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:42,843
I'm just glad you're back.

1801
01:25:06,066 --> 01:25:07,867
All right, hypnotize.

1802
01:25:07,868 --> 01:25:09,334
Make sure you see sound
and lighting.

1803
01:25:09,335 --> 01:25:10,435
They'll hook you up.

1804
01:25:10,436 --> 01:25:13,538
Go on, make some money.
Give him a locker key.

1805
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:15,607
Next!

1806
01:25:15,608 --> 01:25:18,210
Paris.

1807
01:25:18,211 --> 01:25:22,214
Holy fucking shit.

1808
01:25:22,215 --> 01:25:24,716
What are y'all doing here? Hi.

1809
01:25:24,717 --> 01:25:26,718
Give your mama some sugar!

1810
01:25:26,719 --> 01:25:28,687
How are you?
How are you?

1811
01:25:28,688 --> 01:25:31,623
They always come back.
Mm-hmm.

1812
01:25:31,624 --> 01:25:32,825
I am great.

1813
01:25:32,826 --> 01:25:34,193
I'm a little confused,
'cause Dallas,

1814
01:25:34,194 --> 01:25:35,961
he didn't let me know
y'all were coming.

1815
01:25:35,962 --> 01:25:37,696
Where is he?
Dallas is not coming.

1816
01:25:37,697 --> 01:25:38,998
It's just us.

1817
01:25:38,999 --> 01:25:41,633
Baby, I don't have a spot
for you.

1818
01:25:41,634 --> 01:25:43,102
You got a spot for us.
Come on.

1819
01:25:43,103 --> 01:25:47,172
Honey, you know how this works.
You're not special.

1820
01:25:47,173 --> 01:25:49,208
Especially you.
You... you've been out!

1821
01:25:49,209 --> 01:25:51,276
How long?

1822
01:25:51,277 --> 01:25:52,978
"D... D... D... D..."
don't worry about it.

1823
01:25:52,979 --> 01:25:54,446
Couple years. Come on.
You can find us a spot.

1824
01:25:54,447 --> 01:25:56,281
You've not been dancing.
Come on. Look at you.

1825
01:25:56,282 --> 01:25:57,783
Let me see.
Come on. You know I...

1826
01:25:57,784 --> 01:25:59,351
Are you even in shape?
It's like riding a bike.

1827
01:25:59,352 --> 01:26:01,220
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

1828
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:02,487
I don't know.

1829
01:26:02,488 --> 01:26:05,357
Who's this? Big dumb Rick?
How you doing?

1830
01:26:05,358 --> 01:26:07,092
It's dick.
Okay.

1831
01:26:07,093 --> 01:26:09,328
So, you don't have an M.C.
We do have an M.C.

1832
01:26:09,329 --> 01:26:12,397
You don't have an M.C.
What am I supposed to do?

1833
01:26:12,398 --> 01:26:14,867
We do have an M.C.

1834
01:26:14,868 --> 01:26:16,501
Hey, gorgeous.

1835
01:26:16,502 --> 01:26:18,470
Shut the fuck up.

1836
01:26:18,471 --> 01:26:20,339
Mm-hmm.

1837
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:22,341
Hey.

1838
01:26:22,342 --> 01:26:24,144
How you been?

1839
01:26:25,879 --> 01:26:27,312
How have you been?

1840
01:26:27,313 --> 01:26:28,114
Good.

1841
01:26:28,115 --> 01:26:31,084
So, you got a spot for us?

1842
01:26:33,319 --> 01:26:35,387
This girl taught me everything
I know.

1843
01:26:38,291 --> 01:26:41,760
Who is at 10:20?
Bumper Grinders?

1844
01:26:45,265 --> 01:26:46,899
All right.

1845
01:26:46,900 --> 01:26:49,168
For her.

1846
01:26:49,169 --> 01:26:50,535
10:20.

1847
01:26:50,536 --> 01:26:52,071
That's why I love you.

1848
01:26:52,072 --> 01:26:53,472
That's a money spot.

1849
01:26:53,473 --> 01:26:55,574
I expect y'all to make
some money in that spot.

1850
01:26:55,575 --> 01:26:56,675
Thank you.

1851
01:27:31,878 --> 01:27:32,978
How are the knees?

1852
01:27:32,979 --> 01:27:34,013
Rotten.

1853
01:27:34,014 --> 01:27:36,848
Yeah?
You good?

1854
01:27:36,849 --> 01:27:38,317
Tell you the truth, man,

1855
01:27:38,318 --> 01:27:42,354
I haven't felt this nervous
since desert storm.

1856
01:27:42,355 --> 01:27:43,289
What?

1857
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:45,290
H-how have I known you
this long

1858
01:27:45,291 --> 01:27:48,060
and I don't know that you were
in desert storm?

1859
01:27:48,061 --> 01:27:50,363
Just never came up.

1860
01:27:52,232 --> 01:27:53,798
Look, I don't know.

1861
01:27:53,799 --> 01:27:59,371
Me and you, we haven't really
had a chance to have our moment.

1862
01:27:59,372 --> 01:28:00,539
Are we good?

1863
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:04,509
You know, Mike,
when I called you,

1864
01:28:04,510 --> 01:28:06,611
I didn't call
to fuck with you.

1865
01:28:06,612 --> 01:28:09,049
I called
'cause I missed you, man.

1866
01:28:13,319 --> 01:28:15,720
Read my fangs.
Let her make her own decisions.

1867
01:28:15,721 --> 01:28:16,989
Psst!
Whatever.

1868
01:28:16,990 --> 01:28:19,025
Chill, guys.

1869
01:28:19,659 --> 01:28:21,193
I fucked Bella!

1870
01:28:35,341 --> 01:28:36,808
Who's killing it out there?

1871
01:28:36,809 --> 01:28:39,644
Fucking vampire bullshit.

1872
01:28:39,645 --> 01:28:41,046
Did you guys see this?

1873
01:28:41,047 --> 01:28:42,714
They're doing
a fucking "Twilight" routine

1874
01:28:42,715 --> 01:28:43,949
and they're mopping up.

1875
01:28:43,950 --> 01:28:45,985
All those tweeners
are growing up, man.

1876
01:28:45,986 --> 01:28:47,953
Makes perfect sense.

1877
01:28:47,954 --> 01:28:50,922
Mm. That's true.
Yep.

1878
01:28:54,727 --> 01:28:56,095
Wow.
Okay.

1879
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:58,197
Dude, I-I just don't want to
fuck this up, man.

1880
01:28:58,198 --> 01:29:00,332
What are you t...
You're not gonna fuck this up.

1881
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:01,967
And look,
and on the off chance

1882
01:29:01,968 --> 01:29:04,369
that we actually go out there
and shit the bed, who cares?

1883
01:29:04,370 --> 01:29:05,804
Don't say that.
Why? Fuck it.

1884
01:29:05,805 --> 01:29:07,106
Look, I love you guys.

1885
01:29:07,107 --> 01:29:08,740
This trip has been ridiculous
and amazing.

1886
01:29:08,741 --> 01:29:11,743
So please do not make me give
the whole

1887
01:29:11,744 --> 01:29:13,612
"it's not about
how we go out there and do it,

1888
01:29:13,613 --> 01:29:16,448
it's about getting to go out
there and do it together" speech

1889
01:29:16,449 --> 01:29:18,517
that I just fucking gave you.

1890
01:29:18,518 --> 01:29:20,252
W... okay.

1891
01:29:20,253 --> 01:29:21,853
Richie, what are you?

1892
01:29:21,854 --> 01:29:23,455
You're not a fireman.

1893
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,057
What are you?

1894
01:29:25,058 --> 01:29:27,126
I'm a m-male entertainer.

1895
01:29:27,127 --> 01:29:28,160
Entertainer.

1896
01:29:28,161 --> 01:29:29,594
Ooh, yeah.
What are we?

1897
01:29:29,595 --> 01:29:30,996
Fuck it, man.
Male entertainers.

1898
01:29:30,997 --> 01:29:32,131
That's right. Come on.
Get it in.

1899
01:29:32,132 --> 01:29:33,265
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1900
01:29:33,266 --> 01:29:34,499
Hold that up.
Hold that up.

1901
01:29:34,500 --> 01:29:36,068
Look, it's not bro time,
it's showtime.

1902
01:29:36,069 --> 01:29:37,302
Are you guys ready? Yeah.
We're ready.

1903
01:29:37,303 --> 01:29:39,339
All right. Come on.
Let's do this.

1904
01:29:41,241 --> 01:29:43,175
All right. Ready?
One, two, three.

1905
01:29:43,176 --> 01:29:44,643
Male entertainers!

1906
01:29:45,945 --> 01:29:48,313
We're strippers.
We're strippers.

1907
01:29:48,314 --> 01:29:53,052
Whoo! Yes!
Giving it up!

1908
01:29:53,053 --> 01:29:57,156
Oh, Men of Steel
in the "Twilight" routine!

1909
01:29:59,659 --> 01:30:01,093
Oh, that was hot!

1910
01:30:01,094 --> 01:30:03,595
Can I hear y'all say "Hot"?

1911
01:30:03,596 --> 01:30:05,197
Hot!
Whoo!

1912
01:30:05,198 --> 01:30:08,333
That's a nice Southern welcome.

1913
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:14,039
All right.

1914
01:30:14,040 --> 01:30:16,575
Now, I know this is not
a competition,

1915
01:30:16,576 --> 01:30:19,211
but y'all are gonna go home
with your favorites tonight.

1916
01:30:22,014 --> 01:30:24,983
One of my all-time favorites

1917
01:30:24,984 --> 01:30:29,988
is making an appearance on this
stage after a little while away.

1918
01:30:29,989 --> 01:30:31,890
Magical little dancer.

1919
01:30:33,893 --> 01:30:35,294
Mm-hmm.

1920
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:38,631
He's been gone a little while,
but he's back.

1921
01:30:40,166 --> 01:30:43,202
He has hooked up
with the devil himself...

1922
01:30:45,538 --> 01:30:49,608
...and he is back tonight
with those friends

1923
01:30:49,609 --> 01:30:52,277
to entertain
your beautiful selves.

1924
01:30:52,278 --> 01:30:56,281
Here they are...
Reserrection!

1925
01:31:01,487 --> 01:31:03,455
Good evening, friends.

1926
01:31:03,456 --> 01:31:05,924
This is what
you're all here for.

1927
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:11,863
Lift-off in five, four,

1928
01:31:11,864 --> 01:31:14,666
three, two, one.

1929
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,967
Ignition.

1930
01:31:21,141 --> 01:31:22,141
Hold this.

1931
01:31:30,983 --> 01:31:35,821
Just wait till you see
what we got coming up.

1932
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:56,708
Did you like that, ladies?

1933
01:31:58,444 --> 01:32:01,314
Was it good to you?

1934
01:32:02,682 --> 01:32:07,686
Well, just so you know,
my name is Rome.

1935
01:32:10,022 --> 01:32:12,324
I'm gonna be your M.C. Tonight.

1936
01:32:12,325 --> 01:32:16,828
Now, ladies, do you mind
if I refer to you all as queens?

1937
01:32:18,631 --> 01:32:21,400
'Cause every last one of you
up in here is a queen,

1938
01:32:21,401 --> 01:32:23,968
and don't you ever forget it!

1939
01:32:26,872 --> 01:32:32,477
Now, with that being said,
are you ready to be worshipped?

1940
01:32:34,547 --> 01:32:37,816
Are you ready to be exalted?

1941
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:44,389
Are you ready to meet
a special kind of beast

1942
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:47,292
that can bring
all the beauty out in you?

1943
01:32:51,197 --> 01:32:56,134
Well, without further ado, we
have our first king tonight...

1944
01:32:56,135 --> 01:32:57,369
Tarzan.

1945
01:34:07,307 --> 01:34:09,674
I don't know about you, queens,

1946
01:34:09,675 --> 01:34:13,678
but I'd let that beast throw
whatever he wanted on me

1947
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,013
any day.

1948
01:34:18,418 --> 01:34:22,887
You know how the alchemy of
opposites can be so satisfying?

1949
01:34:25,124 --> 01:34:28,460
You have a little bit of cold
with a little bit of hot.

1950
01:34:30,162 --> 01:34:33,998
You have a little bit of yes
with a little bit of no.

1951
01:34:37,069 --> 01:34:41,139
And you know how we like our
kings to be really, really sweet

1952
01:34:41,140 --> 01:34:44,843
and really, really hard
all at the same time.

1953
01:34:46,979 --> 01:34:48,079
Yes, lord.

1954
01:34:49,782 --> 01:34:53,952
I introduce to you
our candy king... Tito!

1955
01:34:53,953 --> 01:34:57,121
Yeah.

1956
01:34:57,122 --> 01:34:59,858
Uh-huh.

1957
01:34:59,859 --> 01:35:01,793

2008
01:37:12,958 --> 01:37:15,226
don't you get tired of everybody

How a good woman
should be sexed?

2012
01:37:27,673 --> 01:37:30,542
Sometimes you just want somebody
to ask you what you want

2013
01:37:30,543 --> 01:37:33,344
and just give it to you
just like that.

2014
01:37:35,380 --> 01:37:39,150
And then whisper in your ear...
"How does it feel?"

2015
01:37:41,353 --> 01:37:44,489

deserves.

2059
01:40:52,211 --> 01:40:57,281
And simply because there are
so many of you and so few of us,

2060
01:40:57,282 --> 01:40:59,984
there is something
we simply can't give.

2061
01:40:59,985 --> 01:41:03,387
But... we're gonna try to
tonight.

2062

We got some serious things

All right.

2101

Is there anybody up in here

But I'm looking for
two grown-ass women

2110
01:44:47,312 --> 01:44:50,448
to deal with these grown-ass men
coming to the stage.

What?

2112
